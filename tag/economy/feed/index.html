								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Defects/Problems Of Indian Agricultural Marketing</h3>
<p>Even though India is an agricultural country, still its <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/05/agricultural-marketing-problems/">agricultural marketing has been defective</a>. The Indian farmers are unable to get reasonable price for the products even after their hard work and are fully exploited by the middlemen.<span id="more-255"></span></p>
<h2>SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Mediators</h4>
<p>The elimination of mediators is necessary from agricultural marketing, because unless the farmer is allowed the facility of direct sales to the customer, he cannot receive a fair price for it. Thus, with the elimination of mediators, ‘consumer grain centers’ should be established where the farmer sells his produce.</li>
<li>
<h4>Use of Standard Weight</h4>
<p>For improving agricultural marketing standard weights are specifically required, these should be manufactured and organised by the government. If, any defect in weights is reported, strict punishment system should be started so that, there should be no fraud in marketing. This would not only improve the marketing system but the fraudulent tendencies of the traders would also be restricted.</li>
<li>
<h4>Loan Facilities</h4>
<p>In villages loans for the farmers are arranged by well-up people, moneylenders etc., who also make a deal of their produce and exploit them on its basis. If, the government establishes banks, cooperative societies or other financial organisations then this problem can be solved. The farmers in the villages should also be encouraged to spend economically and save money so that at the time of need they get money from their savings. By this, the farmers would not sell their produce in a hurry and get full profits out of it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Means of Transport</h4>
<p>The backbone of agricultural marketing is means of transport. Thus, such roads should be constructed in rural areas which remain capable of transportation during all seasons. The tire made bullock carts, diesel or patrol trucks or tractors should be available in rural areas. Similarly, rail and water transport development is also necessary, keeping in view the marketing of agricultural produce, so that the grains and other perishable products can be quickly sent to the market.</li>
<li>
<h4>Publicity of Market Policies</h4>
<p>Sufficient arrangements should be made for the transmission of the authorized prices of agricultural produce and quantity of production etc. so that the facts relating to agricultural marketing can be put before the concerned parties.</li>
<li>
<h4>Training Facilities</h4>
<p>For the improvement of agricultural marketing, it is necessary that arrangements are made for the appropriate training of the employees related to marketing administration. Training with regard to the system of controlled markets etc., is very important for the improvement of agricultural marketing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regulation of ‘Mandis’</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-256 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/integrated-scheme-for-agricultural-marketing-300x201.jpg?resize=300%2C201" alt="Agricultural MArketing" width="300" height="201" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
To provide a fair price to the farmers for their produce in the mandis, ‘organised mandis’ should be established by the government, appropriate arrangements should be made in these mandi-markets for weighting, storage, transport etc. and the farmers should also be given regularly powers in it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Market Survey</h4>
<p>The Indian government should establish Marketing and Inspection Directorate for market survey, which collect useful data relating to production, consumption, export, demand price level, standardization, distribution system etc. and publishes them from time to time.</li>
<li>
<h4>Stores Management</h4>
<p>The Indian government has established The All India Storage Corporation realizing the importance of storage. The object of this corporation is to establish stores in villages, cooperative societies are instructed to organize the stores system. For this they are provided additional, technical and financial assistance.</li>
<li>
<h4>Grading and Standardization of Products</h4>
<p>Though the Agricultural Production Act was passed in 1937 for standardization etc. of agricultural products, still no recognizable progress has been made in this direction. For making an effective system of expansion of the activity of gradation and quality control, laboratories should be established. A central laboratory was established in Nagpur and provisional laboratories were established in Madras, Kanpur, Rajkot, Amritsar, Calcutta and Mumbai but these should be situated in small villages and not in big towns.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<p>The Indian agricultural labor spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.<span id="more-246"></span></p>
<h2>Suggested Remedies Of The Problems</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Distribution of Land</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-247 alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/indian-agricuture-problems-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Agricultural Labor Problems" width="300" height="199" data-recalc-dims="1" />It has always been the effort of the government that whatever additional land is available, it be distributed among the landless. The government has also made efforts to distribute the barren land after making it usable or fertile to theseagricultural labor . It is estimated that till now about more than 10 million agricultural laborers have been provided with land.</li>
<li>
<h4>Industrialization in Villages</h4>
<p>Village <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrialization</a> has been given specific importance during the planning period. The object of this program is to reduce the dependency on agriculture and revive the cottage and small industries in villages.</li>
<li>
<h4>To Spread Education</h4>
<p>To solve the various problems and difficultiesagricultural labor education should be encouraged, so that they can restrict the exploitation of landowners, calculate their correct wages and contribute in the revolutions undergoing in agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Cooperative labor</h4>
<p>To improve the conditions of agricultural labor the expansion of labor cooperative societies is being encouraged, but more development is necessary. In government tenders the labor Cooperative Societies are always given preference.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improvement in Working Conditions</h4>
<p>The working conditions of agricultural laborer should be improved. They should be provided rests and vacations.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regulation of working Hours</h4>
<p>Similar, to the industrial laborers, the working hours of agricultural laborers should also be fixed. Additional wage payment system should be there on working for more than the fixed time.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of slavery</h4>
<p>The Indian constitution has declared Agricultural slavery as crime, so that agricultural laborers are not exploited. Its strict compliance is necessary.</li>
<li>
<h4>Organisations of Agricultural Laborers</h4>
<p>Like the industrial laborers, organisations should also be established for agricultural laborers so that the laborers are able to safeguard their rights. Moreover, labor warfare centers should be established by these organisations at the block levels. At these centers, the entertainment and general education facilities should be available for the laborer.</li>
<li>
<h4>Employment scheme</h4>
<p>This scheme was started in 1971 with a view to provide employment facilities to agricultural laborers. It has been implemented by the government in various forms.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shelter for Landless Laborer</h4>
<p>Science 1971, a scheme to provide shelter to landless laborers is going on. The total expenditure incurred on this program is met by the Central Government.</li>
<li>
<h4>Minimum Wage Act</h4>
<p>The Minimum Wage Act of 1984 has also been implemented on agricultural laborers. In the 14th summit of Indian Labor conference, it was decided that the state government can implement the minimum wages anytime. The minimum wages of agricultural labor in various states like – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, etc. has already been fixed.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Problem of Poverty in India</h2>
<p>India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70 years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form. We have also discussed about various <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/poverty-problem-india/">Reasons Why India Is Still a Poor Country</a>.<br />
<span id="more-190"></span></p>
<h2>Efforts Of Government To Eradicate Poverty In India</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Employment Opportunities</h4>
<p>For eliminating poverty, the government has made wide efforts to provide employment opportunities. At present the policy of ‘Grain for Work’ has been applied, which is giving employment opportunities to million of villagers.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Agriculture</h4>
<div id="attachment_193" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-193" class="size-medium wp-image-193" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NP_Himachal_Pradesh_68_6348260166-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Agricultural Development should Eradicate Poverty" width="300" height="199" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-193" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Development should Eradicate Poverty</p></div>
<p>The government has done commendable work in relating to the availability of irrigation, research, modern techniques, standard quality seeds and fertilizers for the development of agriculture. For irrigation facilities special river-valley projects are made.</li>

<li>
<h4>Family Planning</h4>
<p>The government has encouraged programs for family planning to bring down the birth rate.</li>
<li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Problem In India</h2>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley has written in his book</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-image-159 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Huxley-232x300.jpg?resize=232%2C300" alt="Population Problem In India" width="232" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Julian Huxley</p></div>
<p>India’s condition in relation to population problem is very troublesome. If, India is unable to find a solution to the problem of population, a big political and soda distortion may arise. But, if, it succeeds it would not only get the lead in Asia but (due to wide market) become the center of attraction of the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of population can be solved by the economic development of the country. To curb the increase in population following suggestions can be implemented.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Population Explosion In India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/causes-of-population-explosion-in-india/">Causes of Population Explosion in India</a><br />
<span id="more-158"></span></p>
<h3>Proposed Solutions to Population Problem in India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Strict Implementation of the Rules of Marriage</h4>
<p>Presently the marriageable age for boys and girls under the law is 21 and 18 years, respectively. This should be strictly followed. The parents forbidding this rule must be punished suitably.</li>
<li>
<h4>Reduce the Birth Rate</h4>
<p>To control the birth rate, it is necessary to propagate birth control devices, educating the people, creating profitable job opportunities for them and increasing the living standard of people by this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Propagating Women’s Education</h4>
<p>According to Dr. Alka Cohosh</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s education is necessary in the direction of curbing the rapid increase in population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In- this context the knowledge of family planning should be included in the school syllabus for girls at secondary level.</li>
<li>
<h4>Moral Restraint</h4>
<p>The educational organisations should compulsorily provide moral education. Birth rate reduces by moral restraint. Moral restraint includes late marriage, bachelorhood and living in restraint manner etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tax Relief and Other Benefits</h4>
<p>To make family planning more popular some tax reliefs and other attractions should be given. Unmarried and childless people must be given tax reliefs.</li>
<li>
<h4>Mobile Hospitals</h4>
<p>The state government should arrange mobile hospitals, which should contain all the medicines relating to family planning and other devices and accessories for distribution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Discourage Large Families</h4>
<p>With the object to discourage large families, higher taxes should be imposed on them and tax rebates be offered to small families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Superstitions</h4>
<p>By making the village people more educated, efforts should be made to eliminate their superstitions. Family planning scheme should be approved by the village head or Sar-Panch because on his advice more and more people of the village would follow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Advertising</h4>
<p>For this program, films, songs, speeches, discussions and distribution of advertising material should, be used and the Panchayats and social service organisations must be assisted in this work. People’s attitude will have to be changed for the success of family planning program.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Explosion In India</h2>
<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics. Death rate has become controlled due to modern health and medical facilities and it has reduced to become 15 persons per thousand whereas; birth rate has not got any significant reduction. That is why; this period from 1951 to 1981 is known in India as the period of <strong>Population Explosion.</strong></p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Effect of Population Explosion on Economic Development of India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/?p=158&amp;preview=true">Suggestions To Solve Population Problem</a><br />
<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<h3>Causes of Population Explosion In India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Hot Climate<img class="size-medium wp-image-143 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/population-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="Causes of Population Explosion" width="300" height="169" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h4>
<p>One of the reasons of fast rising population in India is its hot climate. Due to hot climate, maturity comes at early age in boys and girls, due to which they give birth to their children at their early age. This is one of the main reasons for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Child Marriage and Multi Marriage System</h4>
<p>In India the tradition of child marriage and multi-marriage system is prevalent. Marriage of around 80% girls of the country is took place at their young age of between 15 to 20 years. Thus, the result of long married life comes in the farm of excessive childbirth. Tradition of multi-marriage system increases the rotation of childbirth. Apart from it, the increasing tendency of widow marriage, due to the social reforms is also increasing childbirth up to some extent.</li>
<li>
<h4>Religious Superstitions</h4>
<p>Our religious Gurus say that if a Hindu person does not has son, then who will perform the religious ritual in its absence. Due to this, person remains engage in the continuous process of giving birth, one by one, in search of male baby. In the same manner, in Muslims both male and female child is a boon (gift) sent by Allah, prevention of their birth by using any means of family planning is a sin. Due to these reasons, population is continuously increasing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Unawareness</h4>
<p>In India around 36% males and 61% females are illiterate. Neither they have full knowledge of family planning nor they know about the consequences of excessive childbirth. This is one of the reasons of rising population and the situation of Population Explosion’ is emerged.</li>
<li>
<h4>Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to poverty, population is increased of the poor families of our country. People lives in slum, uses their children as a tool, to earn money, hence they always try to increase the number of children in their families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Birth Rate</h4>
<p>In India the average age for marriage is very low, comparatively other nations of the world. This is also a reason for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Death Rate</h4>
<p>In India the death rate from the year 1900 to 1910 was around 35 to 50 persons per thousand, which is now reduced to only 7 to 8 persons per thousand. This become ‘possible in the country by good and hygienic food, pure drinking water, facilities of hospitals, good cleanness, medical facilities at affordable rates and control over Malnutrition, Pneumonia, Cholera, Epidemic etc. Along with, child death rate has reduced to 69 per thousand, comparatively around 218 per thousand in between the years 1916 to 1920. Due to this also, the position of Population Explosion occurred.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indifferent towards Family Planning</h4>
<p>Illiterate persons and people living in rural areas are indifferent towards family planning. They feel fear even by the name of ‘Operation’. They are not interested even in the use of simplest and cheapest means of family planning.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Social Security</h4>
<p>Due to lack of social security system in India, every parent seeks. shelter at the time of crises and for their old age, in childbirth. Whether this would be son or daughter. In the fear of death of their child at childhood, they give birth too many children, so that any of them would be support of their old age.</li>
<li>
<h4>Arrival of Refugees</h4>
<p>Population is very much increased due to continuous arrivals of refugees in India. At the time of division of India and. Pakistan in 1947, more than 1 crore refugees came to India. In 1962 at the time of attack of China, a huge number of Tibetan refugees came to India. Similarly, in 1971, more than 1 crore Bangladeshi refugees, came to India and even today this problem is still continued. Apart from this, continuous arrival of Nepalis, is also still continued. More than 5 lakhs Tamil refugees had come to India due to Sri Lankan Tamil problem. All these are responsible for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Other Causes</h4>
<p>Apart from the above, following are other causes of population explosion<br />
1- Social compulsion of Marriage<br />
2- Lack of means of entertainment<br />
3- Bhagyawati (fateful) view<br />
4- Ambition of big family<br />
5- Betterment in economic position<br />
6- Joint family system, etc.</li>

<h5>Is India over-populated? A critical examination of the present population policy.</h5>
<h3>POPULATION EXPLOSION</h3>
<div id="attachment_130" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-130" class="size-medium wp-image-130" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/over_population-300x181.jpg?resize=300%2C181" alt="Population Explosion" width="300" height="181" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-130" class="wp-caption-text">Hindu devotees try to board a crowded passenger train to take part in the &#8220;Guru Purnima&#8221; festival in Goverdhan town near the northern Indian city of Mathura July 5, 2009.

<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics. Death rate has become controlled due to modern health and medical facilities and it has reduced to become 15 persons per thousand whereas; birth rate has not got any significant reduction. That is why; this period from 1951 to 1981 is known in India as the period of <strong>Population Explosion.</strong></p>

<span id="more-128"></span></p>
<h3>Population Explosion And Economic Development</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, with an increase in population, production also increases and the number of those people also increases, among whom the total increase in production is distributed. Thus, the ultimate effect of increase in population on the level of production per head, would be indifferent or negative. This would depend on the form of increase in population and its directions. If the increase is in the number of dependents, then in place of production, consumers would increase and ultimately the effect on per head production would be adverse. On the contrary, in case of favorable age constitution of the population, its effect on the economic development would be better.</p>
<h3>EFFECTS OF THE INCREASING POPULATION IN INDIA ON ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH</h3>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has adversely affected the economic development and economy, which is clear from the following facts</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>Due to the increasing population, the rate of development has been slow. Whereas; the growth rate of Japan during the previous 10 years has been 15%, while the average growth rate of India has been 4% only.</li>
<li>
<h4>Widespread Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to heavy population the benefit of economic development is almost nil in the country. Though during the last 30 years there has been an increase of 15% in the national income, still the per ca-pita income has increased ‘50% only. About 50% of the population of the country is below the poverty line. Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/poverty-problem-india/">Problem of Poverty in India</a></li>
<li>
<h4>High Prices</h4>
<p>Due to higher population we find scarcity everywhere and due to scarcity, the prices are heading towards an increase. The country has scarcity of food-grains, scarcity of employment, scarcity of essentials, scarcity of houses, scarcity of oil etc..</li>
<li>
<h4>Excess Burden on the Economy</h4>
<p>The 1.5 crore of increase in the population each year is increasing the burden on the Indian economy.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problems in Industrialization</h4>
<p>Our country has poverty and unemployment only due to higher population. The level of savings and investments is lower and mechanization is discouraged due to excess human resources. The small and cottage industries are primary. Due to all these reasons rapid industrialization has not become possible. The slow pace of capital formation is also a hurdle in <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrialization in India.</a></li>
<li>
<h4>Expenditure on Population Control</h4>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has forced expenditure of crores of rupees on population control under planned development. These resources would otherwise have been used in the economic development of the country and the standard of living would have improved.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Unemployment</h4>
<p>The means of employment do not increase at the same rate as the increase in population, as a result the existing <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">problem of unemployment</a> becomes more dreadful. This is the reason for continuous increase in unemployment in India. At the beginning of the first plan, the numbers of unemployed were 35 millions which increased to 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Food-gains</h4>
<p>Due to the rapid increase in population, to fulfill the requirements of the population since several years, millions of tons of food-grains has to be imported. This has adversely affected the foreign trade.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of the Increasing Number of Dependents</h4>
<p>Rapid increase in population increases the burden of number of dependents. According to the 1961 census 47.3% of the population was dependent which increased today to 71.1%.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Capital Formation</h4>
<p>The increase in income due to the economic development is expended in catering to the needs of the increased population, as a result capital formation cannot be increased and investment rate remains lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Hinders the Growth of Agriculture and Industry</h4>
<p>Increasing population hinders the quick development of agriculture.<br />
It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdivision of land reduces the area of land per person</li>
<li>The burden of population on agriculture increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the increasing population hinders the growth of industry also. Rapid increase in population decreases the savings and investment rates. During lack of capital, the pace of industrial development is slow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase In the Burden of Public Utility Services</h4>
<p>For the rapid increase in population, the government has to incur more on housing, education, health, welfare, law and order and security. Thus, funds for development work fall short.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Unemployment In India</h2>
<p>In ordinary language, when a person does not find any work for his livelihood, he is called an unemployed and this problem is called the problem of unemployment. In other words, <span style="color: #216300;">if a person is willing to work and physically fit, and still does not get a job to earn his livelihood, such a condition is called unemployment.</span><br />
<span id="more-117"></span></p>
<h3>CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA</h3>
<p>No one reason can be held responsible for the widespread unemployment in India but the</p>
<p>following are the main causes of the problem in India</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Rapid Increase in Population</h4>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/mumbai-street-kids/" rel="attachment wp-att-118"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-image-118 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mumbai-street-kids-1.jpg?resize=250%2C263&#038;ssl=1" alt="Unemployment In India" width="250" height="263" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Unemployment In India</p></div>
<p>The present increase in population in India has created a imbalance in the demand and supply in the labor market. The increase in techniques, capital formation, natural resources etc. is not at the same rate as the rate of increase in population, due to which the additional people are not getting employment and unemployment is increasing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Uncertainty of Agriculture</h4>
<p>Even after the development of science, agriculture in India is dependent on the mercy of nature. Each year millions of laborers have to lose their jobs due to droughts and floods and other natural calamities due to which uncertainty in agriculture and unemployment arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improper Attitude</h4>
<p>One of the main reasons in this country is the want of a job by the educated people. They do not want to start their own production unit. Unemployment has also increased due to this improper attitude.</li>
<li>
<h4>Employment to Women</h4>
<p>During the decade of 1950 to 1960, very few women were working, but nowadays their number and percentage has increased. This has also increased unemployment among men.</li>
<li>
<h4>Wide Gap between Wages and Productivity</h4>
<p>Inflation is continuing in the country due to which prices keep increasing. Affected by this, the laborers demand more wages and incentives due to which the cost and price of commodities increases, but demand decreases. This follows reduced production and thus, increases in unemployment.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Planning</h4>
<p>Planning work has been going on in the country since independence, but this planning has been defective. A scholars opine that unemployment has also increased due to this reason.</li>
<li>
<h4>Irrational Mechanization</h4>
<p>The government has intentionally encouraged labor substitution activities, keeping in view development of heavy industries, due to which difficulties in the progress of employment opportunities have arisen. It is definite that labor substitution through irrational mechanization would naturally increase unemployment.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of an Extensive Employment Policy</h4>
<p>India has always lacked an extensive and short term employment policy. It is true that unless a solid employment oriented development policy is not evolved and implemented by a stable government of the country, the solution of the problem of unemployment is difficult. Apart from this, the hurdles in production activities, social environment, social evils, religious superstitions, political instability and industrial unrest are increasing the problem of unemployment.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Industrial Development In Developing Countries</h2>
<p>In developed countries there are several favorable conditions for Industrial Development, but in poor and developing countries there are several problems in its development. Even after some significant developments in the field of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">Industrialization in India</a>, the country is still agricultural country and 38% of the national income and 70% of the population depends on the land.<br />
<span id="more-111"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Suppression of Industrial Disputes</h4>
<div id="attachment_137" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-image-137 size-medium" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/labor-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202" alt="Industrial Development" width="300" height="202" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-caption-text">A child working in an auto-parts unit, making wheels for automobiles. Poor economic growth, along with staggering food prices and a slowdown in industrial production, leaves the RBI baffled, while civilians live hand-to-mouth and struggle to make ends meet.</p></div>
<p>It is completely true that a satisfied labor is a valuable wealth of an organisation. A satisfactory and efficient system of arbitration of Industrial disputes is very necessary. Through the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 efforts are made to establish Industrial peace but it is insufficient. Efforts should be made to popularize the Group Discussion method. The policy of worker’s participation in management should be strictly followed. The reasons for the disputes should be analysed impartially and methods should be developed accordingly for their solution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Research and Technology</h4>
<p>In developed countries, continuous research is done on industrial problems and production processes etc. New avenues of development are explored through research on scientific and technical subjects. Now.work has been started on this subject here also.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Power Resources</h4>
<p>India has insufficient power resources. Thus, expansion of power resources and establishment of new units should be done. The government should pay attention to this side to encourage industrial development. Power cuts have to be done from time to time which adversely affects production. Thus, solution of this problem is necessary.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Use of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>India has sufficient natural resources but due to their improper use industrial development has not been done. Thus, for industrial development proper use of natural resources is necessary. Those areas should be explored where possibilities of industrial development are more.</li>
<li>
<h4>Establishment of Specialized Institutions</h4>
<p>Much importance has been paid to establishment of specialized organizations and institutions to provide steadiness to industrial development. Various institutions are established in several states for the development of special Industries, but various other organisations are required in relation to this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Efficient System of Industrial Management</h4>
<p>Educated and skilled managers are required to run the industrial organisations properly, who are able to understand the complicated problems of industrialization and solve them quickly.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encourage Capital Formation</h4>
<p>For industrial development funds are very necessary, though India completely lacks it. Thus, savings should be encouraged more for capital formation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encouragement to Private Sector</h4>
<p>The government should provide more and more facilities to the private sector so that the entrepreneurs come forward to invest more and new industries can be established and old industries are modernized.</li>
<li>
<h4>Earnings in Foreign Exchange</h4>
<p>India lacks funds completely. Thus, to establish Industries in India, foreign investors should be attracted. For this, government should provide them better facilities. In this way, new industries would be established, unemployment would be eliminated and foreign exchange be earned.</li>
<li>
<h4>Rational Taxation Policy</h4>
<p>A proper taxation policy also has an important place in industrial development. Inappropriate taxation, causes problems for industrial organisations, in their development. It is necessary that the needed areas have a liberal taxation policy to motivate them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Industrialization In Developing Countries</h2>
<p>In developed countries there are several favorable conditions for industrialization, but in poor and developing countries there are several problems in its development. Even after some significant developments in the field of Industrialization in India, the country is still agricultural country and 38% of the national income and 70% of the population depends on the land.<br />
<span id="more-106"></span></p>
<h4>Causes Of Industrial Backwardness Of India</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Scarcity of Labor</h4>
<div id="attachment_137" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137" class="size-medium wp-image-137" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/labor-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202" alt="Industrial Developemnt" width="300" height="202" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-caption-text">A child working in an auto-parts unit.</p></div>
<p>Even when the density of population is high in India, still in some areas like- West Bengal, Assam etc. there is scarcity of labor for agricultural activities. Apart from this, due to lack of organised labor markets in the country the supply of labor is completely in the hands of contractors and they intentionally create scarcity of labor in factories. Moreover, due to lack of transportation, long distances and also for other reasons the laborers travel less from one place to another. In this way, even after the abundance of labor their supply in factories is less.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Infrastructure Facilities</h4>
<p>In a developing country like- India there is lack of infrastructure facilities. There is also lack of energy resources for the development and proper running of industries. We are fully aware of the usual situations of closure of industrial units due to shortage of power supply. Also due to lack of transportation means, hurdles arise in the way of industrial development.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Capital</h4>
<p>For the industrial development a country requires huge sources of funds. In poor countries the per ca-pita income is not even sufficient to fulfill the basic requirements of people. For establishment of Multi-national industries, huge quantities of funds are required. To make available such large quantity of capital resources does not become possible for a developing country, like India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Industrial Conflicts</h4>
<p>For industrial development, industrial peace is very necessary. But due to lack of proper labor policy and mutual harmony an environment of conflict can be seen. We are very well aware of the conditions of strikes, lock outs, ‘Gherao’, destruction etc. The route to industrial development is blocked by industrial conflicts.</li>
<li>
<h4>Science and Technology</h4>
<p>The pace of scientific and technological development in the developing countries has been slow by which the industrialization could not progress. Without higher level science and technology and resources it becomes difficult to succeed in industrialization. This reason is more responsible for creating hurdles in way to industrialization.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Efficient Managerial System</h4>
<p>Without an efficient managerial system the running of industrial units becomes impossible. The industrial system of today has become very complicated and it can be run only with the help of an efficient managerial system. But, this kind of managerial system seems deficient.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of an Incentive Oriented Long Term Industrial Policy</h4>
<p>For rapid development of industries, a suitable long term industrial policy is required. In India deficiency of such a policy is felt through which industrialization could have been made, progressive. In such a situation hurdles in industrialization are natural.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Specialized Institutions</h4>
<p>It is necessary for the development of industries that specialized institutions be established for solving problems and difficulties related to industrialization. In India, there has been a lack of such institutions which provide technical counselling in the preparation of industrial plans, test its efficiency and provide financial and technical resources for their establishment.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unfavorable Social Environment</h4>
<p>One of the reasons of Industrial backwardness in India is adverse social environment. The systems of cast-ism, joint family, religions superstitions etc. have created such a social environment which has always been a hurdle in the industrial development of the country. As per the rule of inheritance the land is divided into small portions which restrict capital formation. Due to lack of capital industrial development becomes impossible.</li>
<li>
<h4>Policy of Imperial Preference</h4>
<p>The imperial preference policy was also a hurdle in the development of Indian industries under which goods were imported without import tax under the British rule and the Indians preferred imported goods instead of the home production, and they were cheaper also.</li>
<li>
<h4>Policies During the British Rule</h4>
<p>During the British rule the cottage and small industries directly and indirectly were affected adversely. The existing small and cottage industries in the country were lost due to the administrative policies. Foreign rule continued in the country for a long time whose main aim was export of raw material and import of finished goods in the country.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Efficient Technical Experts</h4>
<p>India is technically backward and lacks skilled experts for machineries because there are no appropriate training facilities for technicians. To establish new industries, technical experts have to be called from other countries which is very expensive. Thus, this is also a reason for Industrial backwardness of India.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An Introduction to Green Revolution</h2>
<div id="attachment_73" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73" class="size-medium wp-image-73" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/norman_borlaug-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Norman Borlaug" width="300" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-73" class="wp-caption-text">American agronomist, Dr Norman Borlaug</p></div>
<p>The Green Revolution was started in India by then Prime Minister Late Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, who gave the slogan of <strong>“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”</strong>, according to which, to make the country powerful from security point of, view, is the responsibility of the soldiers, while making it self sufficient in the field of food grains, is the responsibility of the farmers.<br />

<h3>Criticism, Shortcomings And Failure Of Green Revolution In India</h3>
<p>Some critics are of the view that Green revolution has not been very successful in India. It has benefited only some limited farmers. Due to the preference given to some areas, regional inequalities have arisen. Use of excessive fertilizers has made the land useless. It has been criticized on the basis of the following facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Unemployment</h4>
<p>In the rural areas due to extensive agricultural programs, mechanization has been rapid, which has increased unemployment. It is inappropriate for countries like India, where unemployment is already a problem. In this way <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment is increasing in rural areas</a>.</li>
<li>
<h4>More Dependence on Fertilizers</h4>
<p>In this agricultural policy, use of fertilizers is given more importance than irrigation, which is not appropriate because in the absence of irrigation, fertilizers have no use. Due to this reason, the fertility of land has decreased in some areas.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economic Inequalities</h4>
<p>The benefit of Green revolution has been received mainly by the prosper farmers. The poor farmers have not benefited from this policy. It has enhanced the economic inequalities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regional Inequalities</h4>
<p>Under the Green Revolution movement, the implementation of agricultural resources was aimed only in naturally favorable areas, due to which some areas developed and some places were not given any attention. This increased regional difficulties. The prosper areas became more prosper and the backward became more backward.</li>
<li>
<h4>Benefited only a Few Crops</h4>
<p>Green revolution has been successful only on a few crops, specially wheat, rice, maize, jwar and baajra. No work has been done for other crops. Specially relating to crops like cotton or sugarcane etc..</li>
<li>
<h4>Difficulty in Storage</h4>
<p>The progress of agriculture has given rise to an additional problem of storage. At present, the storage capacity of our country is 2.5 crore tons, which is not sufficient with regard to production.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Experience</h4>
<p>Due to unavailability of scientifically developed seeds in India, farmers have been lacking experience experience about them. What effect these modem resources would have on Indian conditions, is not known certainly. Working without experience is like walking without knowing the path, where possibility of going in the wrong direction is more.</li>
<li>
<h4>Difficulties in the Use of Modern Techniques</h4>
<p>Most of the Indian farmers have small lands, hence they have problems in using the modern equipment designed for big lands. In this way, these farmers have remained in acquitted from the benefits of green revolution.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Suggestions For Success of Green Revolution</h3>

<ol>
<li>The small farmers should be provided credit facilities at lower interest rates than the big farmers.</li>
<li>The modern techniques should be made profitable for small farmers.</li>
<li>The land development programs should be made effective and activated on a large scale.</li>
<li>The marketing system of agriculture should be improved.</li>
<li>To solve the problem of unemployment due to increased use of instruments and machines the small and cottage industries should be rapidly developed.</li>
<li>The labor intensive techniques should be given preference.</li>
<li>Improved variety of seeds should be developed.</li>
<li>Crop insurance should be started on a large scale for farmers.</li>
<li>The education, research and expansion services should be developed in villages</li>
<li>Irrigation facilities should be expanded.</li>
<li>Landless laborers and farmers should be united.</li>
<li>Programs for plant protection should be expanded.</li>
