								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Meaning of Utility</h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-373 size-thumbnail alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/utility-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Utility" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" />Utility means the power that satisfies any want. It is such an internal quality; which is found in all commodities desired by a person. The quality (power or capability) of commodity which satisfies the human want; directly or indirectly is called <em>Utility</em>. Those commodities, which have wants satisfying power are called &#8216;<em>Useful Commodities</em>&#8216;.<br />
<span id="more-372"></span></p>
<h3>Concept of Utility</h3>
<p>Wants satisfying power&#8217; has two meanings</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity to gain satisfaction</li>
<li>Actual Realised satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated (Assumed) Satisfaction of a particular commodity can be equal to, less or more than, the satisfaction, actually realised by consuming that commodity. Estimated satisfaction for a certain commodity depends up on the intensity of desire of a particular person or depends on desirableness.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Utility</h3>
<ol>
<li>It is a psychological concept, which can only be felt. It cannot be seen.</li>
<li>It depends on the intensity of wants.</li>
<li>It differs from usefulness. Such as, Cigarette has satisfaction for cigarette smoker, but it is injurious (not useful) to health.</li>
<li>Its concept is indifferent from moral point of view.  Such as &#8211; Wine, in spite of being useful for a wine drinker; it is not considered good for moral point of view.</li>
<li>It is related with Consumable Goods only.</li>
<li>It is different from satisfaction</li>
<li>It does not depend on Actual consumption. It is assumption.</li>
<li>It is measurable.</li>
<li>It can be both positive as well as negative. Up to the point of maximum satisfaction, it is positive and after that negative utility is derived.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Types</h4>
