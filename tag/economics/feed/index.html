								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>At a given time the overall utility derived from the consumption of all units of a commodity is called Total Utility.</p>
<p><span id="more-405"></span></p>
<p>According to Professor Meyors,</p>
<blockquote><p>Total utility is the sum of <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/marginal-utility/">marginal utilities</a>, associated with the consumption of successive units.</p></blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Units of Bread</th>
<th>Marginal Utility</th>
<th colspan="2">Total Utility</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>50</td>
<td rowspan="5">Increasing</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>t is clear from the table that consumption of one unit of bread yields utility equal to 50, While 90 utility is derived from the consumption of second unit. In this way, total 150 utility is derived from the consumption of 5 units of bread.</p>
<h3>Mutual relationship between two type of utilities</h3>
<p>It is dear from above table that</p>
<ol>
<li>From the consumption of each next unit of commodity, marginal utility is derived at decreasing rate and total utility increases.</li>
<li>It increases at decreasing rate.</li>
<li>When marginal utility is zero, it is maximum and positive</li>
<li>Even after getting the maximum satisfaction, if consumption still continues, Negative marginal utility is derived and due to this negative marginal utility, total utility also begin to decrease.</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Definition of Marginal Utility</h2>
<p>Marginal Utility is the utility which is derived from the consumption of an additional unit of a commodity. In other words, it is the addition to<a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/total-utility/"> total utility</a>, resulting from adding one unit to the consumption of a commodity.</p>
<p>Example : Ram consumes 6 ice creams at a time. In this case, 6 ice creams will be the marginal unit and utility derived by him from adding one unit to the consumption of a commodity.</p>
<p><span id="more-390"></span></p>
<p>According to modern economist Prof. Bhatia,</p>
<blockquote><p>Marginal Utility may also be defined as the addition made to total utility by the increment of the last unit consumed.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Meaning of Utility</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/utility/">Utility</a> means the power that satisfies any want. It is such an internal quality which is found in all commodities desired by a person. The quality (power or capability) of commodity which satisfies the human want; directly or indirectly is called Utility. Those commodities, which have wants satisfying power are called &#8216;Useful Commodities&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Types of Marginal Utility</h2>
<p>The intensity of want of a commodity decreases due to continuous consumption of its successive units at the same time and a situation also comes, when more units of that commodity are consumed, worthlessness is derived at the place of utility.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Positive Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>Until we get maximum satisfaction by the consumption of a commodity, we feel the want of that commodity again and again. We get some satisfaction by the use of every unit. This type of utility is called Positive Marginal Utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Zero Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>When we do not get satisfaction from the consumption of next unit of a commodity and there is also no loss if we do not consume that commodity; at that time, the utility of that commodity will be zero for us. It is called Zero Marginal Utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Negative Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>When disutility occurs from consumption of a commodity, it is called Negative Marginal Utility.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Clarification of Different types of Marginal Utility</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Units of Bread</th>
<th>Marginal Utility</th>
<th>Type of Utility</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>50</td>
<td rowspan="5">Positive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>-10</td>
<td rowspan="2">Negative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>-20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above table when a person consumes first unit of bread; he get utility equal to 50 cents. If, he continues the consumption of bread, he get the utility 40 from second unit and 30 from third unit, 20 from fourth unit and 10 from fifth unit and zero from sixth unit. Thus, it is clear that as he increases the number of units of bread; he gets utility at decreasing rate from each next unit. This process of positive utility continues till the consumption of fifth unit of bread, at this point, it becomes 10. Up to this level, the utility is Positive. He gets zero utility from consuming sixth unit of bread and this is the maximum limit of satisfaction.</p>
<p>If even after this limit, he continues the consumption of bread, he will get negative utility from seventh and eighth unit of bread. He will get dissatisfaction at the place of satisfaction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Difference Between Micro and Macro Economics</h2>
<p>Micro and Macro economics, both are absolutely vital and a person is only half educated it he understand the one, while being ignorant of the other.<span id="more-365"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Using micro approach, the individual units are studied, like, the study of a firm or an industry, whereas, using macro approach, the whole of the economy is studied, like national income, national investment etc.</li>
<li>Under <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/10/micro-economics/">micro economics</a>, a perishable individual, consumer or a firm is studied whereas in macro the imperishable (or undying) society is studied.</li>
<li>Slow changes take place in a society whereas in an individual&#8217;s life, mostly quick changes take place.. On this basis quick changes take place in micro (individual) economics, whereas comparatively slow changes take place in macro (group) economics.</li>
<li>According to Prof. J. K. Mehta, micro economics is like an open economy whereas, macro economics is like a closed economy because knowledge about-an individual person or a firm can be easily gained but a lot of time and problems will be faced in gaining knowledge about the entire society</li>
<li>Sometimes, economic activities are changing from the point of view of an individual (micro) but are stable from the point of view of a group (macro). For example, it may be -possible that them is no change in the population of a country but the size of the families in that country getting bigger or smaller.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Even after the above differences it can be said that individual economic analysis (micro) and group economic analysis (macro) are two methods of the study of economic science. In the view of Prof Samuelson</p>
<blockquote><p>There is not really any opposition between micro and macro, both are absolutely vital and a person is only half educated it he understand the one, while being ignorant of the other.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Meaning of Macro Economics</h3>
<p>The word <em>macro </em>means big. Thus, in Macro Economics, either the whole economy is studied or those big units which are related to the economy as a whole.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In the words of Prof. Boulding</p>
<blockquote><p>Macro Economics deals not with individual quantities as such but aggregates of these quantities, not with individual incomes but national income, not with individual output but with national output.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, macro economics studies the various groups related to the whole economy, like, national savings, national income, national consumption, total employment, total production, etc..<br />
<span id="more-355"></span></p>
<h4>Historical Background</h4>
<p>In its development, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/keynesian-theory/">Keynes&#8217; book </a><em>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money </em>played a significant role. Apart from Kaynes, economists like <strong>Walras, Wicksell, Bohm Bowerk and Fisher</strong> also contributed significantly.</p>
<h2>Importance and Merits of Macro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Importance in Planning</h4>
<p>Macro economies has played a very important role in determining the policies of the modern planning era. It acts as a pathfinder in the determination of economic policies.</li>
<li>
<h4>Importance in Special Areas</h4>
<p>The fields of international trade, national income, national investment are such areas where only macro approach applies not <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/10/micro-economics/">micro economics</a>.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in Understanding Paradoxes</h4>
<p>It is necessary-to take the help of macro economics in understanding the situation under paradoxes because sometimes conclusions drawn-for individual units are not appropriate from the point of view the whole economy. For example, individual savings is a. blessing, while suppose situation like every person of that country is saving money, will be a curse.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in Monetary Policies</h4>
<p>Many monetary problems, like, inflation and deflation etc. can be analysed with the help of macro approach and controlled by adopting the appropriate monetary policy.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations and Demerits of Macro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>No importance to Individual Units</h4>
<p>Under macro economics, in comparison to individual units, a group of units is given more importance. But it is not necessary that what is right for individual person, would also right for a group. For example, an individual can withdraw the amount saved in a bank at a time but if all individuals do the same, the banks will have to close down.</li>
<li>
<h4>Difficulty in Measuring Aggregates</h4>
<p>Under macro economics, measurement of aggregates becomes very difficult. The reason is that there are numerous items in a group, which are sometimes not possible to measure separately.</li>
<li>
<h4>Danger in Ignorance of Individual Units</h4>
<p>When we study a group under macro economics, there is always a danger that we may ignore the numerous individual units which form the group.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction to Micro Economics</h3>
<p>In the present times, the study of economics is done from two viewpoints namely <em>Micro</em> and <em>Macro</em>. From the first viewpoint, the economic problems of various units, like &#8211; individuals, families, firms etc. are studied individually, whereas; from the second viewpoint, the same units of persons, families, firms etc., are studied in a combined form. Micro Economics is concerned with a specific, particular or an individual whereas; Macro Economics is concerned with a <em>group</em>.</p>
<h3>Meaning</h3>
<p>The word <em>micro </em>means very small portion. From this point of view, micro economics is the study of specific economics units of the whole economy. Under this, a commodity, a consumer, a firm or an industry is studied individually.<br />
<span id="more-351"></span></p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>According to Kenneth E. Boulding,</p>
<blockquote><p>In micro economics, particular firms, particular families, individual prices, wages, incomes, particular industries and specific commodities are studied.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Historical Background</h4>
<p>Prof. <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/tag/adam-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Smith</a> is called the father of micro economics but its development was done by Prof. <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/tag/alfred-marshall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfred Marshall</a> and his companions.</p>
<h2>Importance and Merits of Micro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Correct knowledge of the nature of individual units</h4>
<p>It makes analytical study of individual units, which helps in understanding the nature of economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in the determination of economic policies</h4>
<p>It provides significant contribution in the determination of individual economic policies.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in solving economic problems</h4>
<p>It helps in providing solutions to the economic problems of individual units by studying their economic nature.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations and Demerits of Micro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Ignore the whole</h4>
<p>It ignores the whole economy and studies only the small parts of the economy. Due to this, it does not represent the correct form of the whole economy.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unsuitable in many areas</h4>
<p>There are many areas of economic analysis, where the use of micro economics is unsuitable. In the fields like, international trade, national income, national savings, nation -investments etc. There is limited use micro economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unrealistic assumption</h4>
<p>The assumption that the laws of micro economics are also applicable on macro-economics is not correct because it is not necessary that what is appropriate for an individual concern is also appropriate for the whole economy. For example, by the point of view of an employment, it is good for a person and a country that a person of that country is employed at a high post but if each individual of that country is employed at high posts, then it would become a curse for the murky. This is because if even a small activity of daily life is hindered, it would disturb the whole country, like; lack of sweeper in a country would make that country a dust-bin.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Similarities Between The Definition Of Marshall And Robbins</h2>
<p>The following similarities are found in the definitions Of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Prof Marshall</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">Prof Robbins</a><span id="more-332"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Prof. Marshall used the word &#8216;wealth&#8217;, in his definition, whereas; Prof. Robbins has related Economics with &#8216;limited means&#8217; (or scarcity). Therefore, there is similarity in the views of both because wealth is that object or service, whose supply is limited. Thus, Prof. Robbins limited resource (scarcity) statement, is another form of money.</li>
<li>Both the intellectuals consider Economics as a science. In this way, there is similarity in the views of Marshall and Robbins on this matter.</li>
<li>According to Prof Robbins, the utilization of resources must be done economically, so that production or satisfaction becomes maximum. Marshall has expressed the same view, as &#8216;material welfare&#8217; or &#8216;human welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>The ancient Economists had considered Economics as the Science of Wealth, which was interpreted as man is for money, instead of that money is for man. In this manner, the main subject matter of Economics was considered, as wealth and not man. Marshall used the word &#8216;Mankind&#8217; and Robbins used words like &#8216;Human Behavior&#8217;, clearly stated that in Economics, man has an important place instead of wealth.</li>

<p>The definitions of Prof. Marshall and Prof. Robbins have the following dissimilarities</p>
<ol>
<li>Marshall definition is simple and an. ordinary person. can easily understand it. From this point of view, it is practical, but Robbins definition is so much theoretical, that is why, it is very difficult and beyond the understanding power of ordinary people.</li>
<li>According to Prof. Marshall, Economics has a close relation with &#8216;Human Welfare&#8217;, whereas; according to Robbins, Economics is not related to any &#8216;Welfare&#8217; or &#8216;Non-welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>Marshall presented Economics in the form of both a science and an art, but Robbins accepted it only in the form of a real science.</li>
<li>Marshall has considered Economics as a &#8216;social science&#8217;. According to him, it studies only the activities of social, normal and real persons, whereas; according to Robbins, it studies the both socialistic and sole (aloof), in this way, it is a human science.</li>
<li>Marshall has said that Economics studies only those activities, which are related to wealth and which can be measured in money, whereas; Robbins has said that Economics also studies those activities, which have no relation which money, like &#8211; the study of activities related to &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Which Definition is Superior?</h3>
<p>It is difficult to say which definition between Marshall&#8217;s and Robbins is superior. Actually both definitions are complementary to each other. Marshall&#8217;s definition is easier having a practical view, whereas; Robbins definition has theoretical view point. Both Economists have seen the same thing, from different angles. In Marshall&#8217;s view, wealth is in the form of prime means, whereas; Prof. Robbins has taken in his views, &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;, instead of &#8216;wealth&#8217;. From theoretical point of view, if, Robbins definition is superior, while from practical point of view, Marshall&#8217;s definition is superior.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Criticism Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">Robbins definition</a> could be criticized in a way that it does not practically applicable, it provide only a theoretical view.<span id="more-321"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unnecessary Enlargement of the Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>Robbins&#8217;s definition has unnecessarily widened the scope of economics. According to Robbins, any activity of choosing, whether it is economic or not, comes under the scope of economics. Example &#8211; If a student thinks of choosing between studies and cinema, this activity of decision making will also come under the scope of economics. But critics are of the opinion that uneconomic activities should not be included in economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Neutrality of Ends</h4>
<p>In Robbins view, it is the duty of the economist to explore and explain and riot to support or criticize. Thus, economics is neutral between ends and the economist is not concerned with, what is right and what is wrong. But this view of Robbins is highly criticized.</li>
<li>
<h4>Based on Theoretical View</h4>
<p>In Robbins view, there is no place for humanity, and human welfare and his definition lacks practicality. Thus, we can only call it a theoretical view. Such economics which cannot be applied in practical life, it does not retain any utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Applicable only on a Few Countries</h4>
<p>Robbins definition is applicable in only those countries where Barter Exchange System is prevalent. In a barter less economy, Robbins economics will prove a waste because in such an economy, no question arises of scarcity and decision related problems.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unrealistic Assumption</h4>
<p>Robbins believes that each individual does only that activities from which he derives maximum satisfaction. But in practical life, an individual does not always compare the satisfaction he derives from different activities but usually he acts without thinking so much. Thus, this assumption of Robbins is unrealistic.</li>
<li>
<h4>Fixed Economic Laws</h4>
<p>According to Robbins definition, economic laws are as certain fixed, stable and true as the rules of natural sciences. in this context we must not forget that human behavior keeps changing with time and economic laws are concerned with humans only. Thus, economics laws and principles do not remain so stable under variable conditions, as Robbins states.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction Of Robbins</h3>
<div id="attachment_319" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-image-319 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/robbins-1.jpg?resize=220%2C289&#038;ssl=1" alt="Robbins definition of Economics" width="220" height="289" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-caption-text">Prof Lionel Robbins</p></div>
<p>Robbins definition of Economics challenged Dr.<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/"> Marshall definition of Economics</a> which was a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. Before Prof. Lionel Robbins, Prof. Marshall tried to give complete and faultless definition of economics. At that time people started thinking that the Economic Science has completely develop and matured. But in 1932, after the publication of Prof. Robbins&#8217;s book <strong><em>An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Social Science</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">a controversy roused in the field of Economics</a>. He tried to give economics another shape, apart from material welfare. In the words of Robbins</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relation between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<h2>Characteristics Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p>Following are the main characteristics of Robbins&#8217; definition</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unlimited Wants</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins definition, human wants are unlimited. On satisfaction of one wants, another want arises immediately.and this sequence continues forever.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scarce Means</h4>
<p>Robbins definition stated that through on one side human needs are unlimited yet on the other side, the means to satisfy these wants, like- time, power, money etc. are also limited. Due to this, many of man&#8217;s needs remain unsatisfied.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alternative Use of Scarce Means</h4>
<p>In Robbins&#8217;s view though the to &#8216;satisfy man&#8217;s needs are scarce, yet he has alternative uses. In other words, he can use every resource in various objectives and activities. For example &#8211; such a resource like land can be use in many ways, such as it can be used for agriculture or for building a house or to established a factory etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Variation in the Intensity of wants</h4>
<p>Robbins definition states that the intensity of man&#8217;s needs is different. Some wants are more intense than the others. Since our means are limited and all wants cannot be satisfied with the limited means; as a result, we have to select some more intense wants from our unlimited wants and the less intense wants have to be either dropped or postponed to a future date.</li>

This definition was recognized between 1890 to 1932 and it seemed that the controversy relating to the definition of Economics had ended. But, a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science&#8217; in 1932 criticized Marshall&#8217;s definition in loud words, which are as follows &#8211;<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Illusion of Anti-Immateriality</h4>
<p>Dr Marshall has restricted the relation of Economics only to the attainment of material resources and its consumption, whereas, Economics also includes the immaterial resources like services of advocates, teachers and other employees. That is the reason Robin said</p>
<blockquote><p>The Economist who keeps in mind only material study, cannot save themselves from the blame of being biased to one aspect.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Vagueness of Ordinary Business Activity</h4>
<p>The phrase used by Dr. Marshall, &#8220;The activities relating to the ordinary business of life is unclear and vague, because it is not cleat, what activities of man corm under ordinary business and winch activities are outside its area.&#8221; According to Prof. Robbins, though there are several such activities which come under an ordinary business of life, yet are studied in Economics, like &#8211; study of economy at the time of war, conditions of Imperfect Competition, Monopoly, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unclear Economic Activities</h4>
<p>Marshall has divided human activities in two parts, Economic and Non-economic, which is unfair because a similar activity of man can be economic and non-economic also at different times. Like &#8211; sweeping his own house by a servant is a non-economic activity, while sweeping his employer&#8217;s house. becomes an economic activity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unfair to Relies Economics with Human Welfare</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins, Economics has no relation with human welfare, Under this, all kind of activities must be studied, whether it is related to human welfare or not. He gives the following arguments to prove this</p>
<ul>
<li>Production and consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants It not ,beneficial for human welfare, still it is studied in Economics.</li>
<li>Human welfare is not a definite idea; It keeps changing according to time, place and conditions.</li>
<li>Human welfare cannot be measured in quantitative terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is not only a Social Science but also Human Science</h4>
<p>Prof. Marshall has restricted the field of Economics, by calling it only a social science. On the contrary, according to Prof. Robbins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is a human science, whose basic rules apply to an insane, miser, sage or Mahatma in the same mariner, as it applies to all the persons living in a society.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>The welfare definitions have restricted the scope of Economics because according to these definitions only material, ordinary and economic activities are studied in Economics. All other activities are outside the scope of Economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is Neutral between Objectives</h4>
<p>According to Robbins, &#8220;Economics is neutral against objectives. Objectives may be good and also bad, but this has no relation with Economics.&#8221; In his book, Prof. Robbins writes, &#8220;Whatever Economics is concerned with; it is not concerned with the causes of material welfare&#8221;.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is a Real Science</h4>
<p>On the basis of the definition of Marshall, Economics has become an ideal science, whereas; according to Robbins, &#8220;<strong>Economics is a real science and not an ideal science</strong>&#8220;.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above criticisms, it is clear that Marshall&#8217;s definition is narrow and unscientific, and is stuck in the net of immateriality.</p>
<p>Even after the above criticisms, Marshall&#8217;s definition is still a source of inspiration, to the readers. Economists, like &#8211; <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/keynesian-theory/">J.M. Keynes</a>, Hyne and Newman etc. consider Marshall yet as a &#8220;Great knowledgeable Economist&#8221;</p>

<h3>Introduction Of Marshall</h3>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 223px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-image-288 size-medium" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg?resize=213%2C300" alt="Principle Of Economics" width="213" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Alfred Marshall</p></div>
<p>Marshall definition of Economics was first to challenge Adam Smith definition. Dr. Alfred Marshall (Born. 26 July, 1842, Died 13 July 1924) was the first Economist, who denied the wealth related definitions of Adam Smith, which was in vogue for a long time, in his two books published in 1890 named <strong>Principles of Economics</strong> and <strong>Economics of Industry</strong>, and declared them wrong, and defined it as not the study of human welfare. He gave, &#8216;Man&#8217; the first place and Wealth&#8217; as secondary and clarified that wealth is for man and man is not for wealth. Wealth is not the &#8216;End&#8217;, it is only a &#8216;Means&#8217; to attain welfare. He presented the definition of Economics in this manner in his book &#8216;Economics of Industry&#8217;.</p>
<p>However Marshall definition was also <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">criticized</a> later by a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science</a>&#8216; in 1932.<br />
<span id="more-287"></span></p>
<h2>Marshall Definition Of Economics</h2>
<p>Economics is the study of human activities in the ordinary course of business. It studies how man attains his income and how he utilizes it. In this way, it studies wealth, on one hand and on the other hand, it is a part of the study of man, which is more important.<br />
According to this definition, it becomes the science of human activities instead of science of wealth. In his second book, &#8216;Principles of Economics&#8217;, Dr. Marshall defined it in these words</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the study of humans, in relation to the ordinary business of life. It studies that portion of the personal and social activities, which are closely related to the attainment of material resources, related to welfare and its utilization.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Characteristics Of Marshall&#8217;s Definition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Greater Emphasis on Human Aspect</h4>
<p>Marshall has given a balanced importance to <em>Means</em> and <em>Ends</em>, through his definition. He has stated in clear words, that it is on one hand is the study of wealth and on the other hand, more important to this is the study of human aspect. In this way, he removed the defect of ignorance of human aspect, in the old views of Adam Smith&#8217;s time, and gave more emphasis to human aspect in clear words.</li>
<li>
<h4>Material Welfare</h4>
<p>Marshall in his definition gave more importance to the means of material gains or material welfare. According to him, it studies, those material resources, on which welfare depends. In this a way, Marshall accepted the material welfare aspect. Other famous economists like &#8211; Pigou, Cannon, Beveridge etc. also supported it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of Social, Normal and Real Persons</h4>
<p>According to Marshall, economics studies only social, normal and real persons. The study of persons living outside the society or in forests, who-are unusual, alone and abnormal, is not done in it. The activities of unusual persons like &#8211; an insane, a miser, a saint or Mahatma etc. are said to be outside the area of the subject Matter of economics. According to Marshall, it studies the economic activities of only the social, normal and real persons.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of the Ordinary Business Activities of Life</h4>
<p>In his definition, Marshall paid emphasis to the <em>Ordinary Business Activities</em>. These &#8216;ordinary business activities&#8217; refers to those economic activities, which are related to the attainment and utilization of wealth. In this manner, Marshall gave a clear place, to human economic activities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Practical Point of View</h4>
<p>Marshall adopted a more practical point of view, in defining economics, He gave equal importance to both theoretical and practical aspects of economic activities, and accepted the scientific and artistic aspects of economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simple and Clear Definition</h4>
<p>The definition given by Marshall is very simple and clear. According to him, economics studies the activities of earning and expending wealth by man.</li>
