								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Labor</h2>
<p>Agricultural labor is that person who works on another land, does not participate in farm management and its maintenance, and receives money or a portion of the harvest in consideration for his service. He neither has any rights regarding the land, nor does he have to bear any risk regarding the farm. Briefly by agricultural labor we mean’ such laborers who <em><strong>“earn their livelihood by working on agricultural farms.”</strong></em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Second Agricultural Labor Investigation society</p>
<blockquote><p>Agricultural labor refers to that person who receives more than half of the income from agriculture. The agricultural labor family refers to that family, whose more than half of the income from agriculture.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-233"></span></p>
<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<div id="attachment_234" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" class="size-medium wp-image-234" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agri_labor-300x220.jpg?resize=300%2C220" alt="Agricultural Labor" width="300" height="220" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Labor</p></div>
<p>Describing the conditions of Indian agricultural labor P.T.Mayya writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Indian laborer spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excess Working Hours</h4>
<p>The working hours of these laborer are not only irregular but also excessive. They have to work since morning to late night. His working hours change with harvest, season and work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Seasonal Employment</h4>
<p>The agricultural labor does not get work for the whole year. According to the Second Agricultural Labor Investigation Society, a Seasonal labor gets an average of 197 days of work in a year. Similarly, child labor gets 204 days and women get 141 days of employment. Thus, their average annual income is very lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Low Wages</h4>
<p>The wage level of agricultural labors very low as compared to that of industrial labor. It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in landless laborers</li>
<li>lack of non-agricultural areas of work in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Agricultural Slavery</h4>
<p>Majority of agricultural laborers are landless and of backward classes. Due to their lower social status they are treated as animals. Big land owners make them work as slaves. They are used as laborers and in return given minimum wages.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indebtedness</h4>
<p>Due to lower income, the indebtedness of agricultural farmers is increasing. They hesitate in negotiating their wages with the land owners in the fear that their services would be terminated. The laborers remain indebted even after working with the land owners for their whole life.</li>
<li>
<h4>Not United</h4>
<p>Since the agricultural laborers are spread in millions of village all over the country they lack unity. Thus, they are unable to negotiate their wages etc. with the land owners by uniting themselves.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Child and Women Laborers</h4>
<p>Due to lower income the children and women of agricultural laborers are also forced to work for their livelihood. The child and women laborers are made to work more for livelihood. Thus, exploitation of child labor and woman labor is a major problem in the field of agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lower Social Status</h4>
<p>Most of the agricultural laborers are of backward classes who have been exploited since centuries. Due to this reason also their social status is lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Other Jobs</h4>
<p>There is shortage of other jobs in villages. Thus, if the crop is destroyed by floods, famines etc., it becomes difficult for the agricultural labor to survive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Housing Problem</h4>
<p>The landless laborers have no private house. They live in cottages, made on the useless land of the landowners with their permission and in its return they have to work without payment, for the landowners. When a number of people live under the same root, the physical, social, moral and religious problem arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment due to mechanization</h4>
<p>At the present times, due to increase in the use of machines, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment</a> rate among the illiterate agricultural farmers is increasing, which is a serious problem for them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Agricultural Productivity?</h2>
<p>Agricultural productivity (<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/04/low-agricultural-productivity-india/">Low Agricultural Productivity In India</a>) is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult.<span id="more-230"></span></p>
<h3>Suggestions For Problem Of Low Productivity in India</h3>
<p>While agricultural production so low in India here are few measures that could be taken to overcome this problem in near future. Following are some suggestions to deal with the problem of low production in India.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Expansion of Credit Facilities</h4>
<p>To increase agricultural productivity, it is essential that the credit facilities be appropriately expanded. This would help the farmers fulfill their short term, medium term and long term financial requirements easily. All efforts should be made to provide credit facility to farmers quickly and economically.</li>
<li>
<h4>Education and Training of Farmer</h4>
<p>Through education and training, the farmers should be encouraged to improve the farming techniques, use scientific methods to increase productivity and enhance their skills. Proper education system would eliminate superstition, conservatism and ignorance among farmers and it would be easier to increase the productivity by the development of these human qualities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improvement of Irrigation Facilities</h4>
<div id="attachment_231" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231" class="size-medium wp-image-231" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/irrigation-300x204.jpg?resize=300%2C204" alt="Agricultural Productivity" width="300" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-231" class="wp-caption-text">The Narmada Main Canal is the largest irrigation lined canal in the world, supplying water at a capacity of 1,133 cubic meters a second.</p></div>
<p>Indian agriculture is called a gamble of rains. This condition should quickly end. A network of irrigation facilities should be spread. The small irrigation plans and the wells and tube-wells system should be expanded on a preference basis.</li>
<li>
<h4>Plant Protection Scheme</h4>
<p>Arrangements should be made to protect the plants from insects and diseases. More insecticides should be manufactured and arrangements should be made to increase their use. Development of research work relating to diseases should be done to benefit from these researches.</li>
<li>
<h4>Technical Suggestions</h4>
<p>To increase the agricultural productivity it is necessary to have a technical service system for scientific solution for production problems. Agricultural productivity can be increased on the basis of these technical suggestions.</li>
<li>
<h4>Expansion of Marketing Facilities</h4>
<p>Making the marketing system better and lawful to remove its defects would increase productivity. When the farmers would receive fair price for their labor, then they will perform the production activity and more skillfully.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encouragement to Cooperative Farming</h4>
<p>To increase productivity and make the agricultural system progressive, cooperative farming should be rapidly expanded. Cooperative farming would help the farmer correct the present uneconomical methods of farming.</li>
<li>
<h4>Population control</h4>
<p>Necessary effort should be made in the direction of reducing the pressure of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/population-problem-solution/">high population</a> on agricultural land.</li>
<li>
<h4>Health Improvement</h4>
<p>Effective efforts should be made in improvement of the health of farmers. System of proper and balanced diet and health facilities should be established. Only the healthy farmers can attain the objective of increasing productivity. Lack of efficiency of unhealthy farmers resulting in low productivity, it can be removed only by improvement in health facilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scientific Methods of Cultivation</h4>
<p>Cultivation methods should be improved and the should be scientifically carried out, crops should be properly distributed, techniques based on agricultural research should be adopted. All the activities like ploughing, sowing, irrigation etc. should be properly carried out, then only production can be increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper and Quick Implementation of Land Reforms</h4>
<p>Proper and quick implementation of land reforms should be done, so that the farmers are encouraged to bring some basic improvements. Elimination of mediators and permanent ownership of land to farmers should be done immediately.</li>
<li>
<h4>To Initiate Crop Insurance Scheme</h4>
<p>Implementation of crop insurance Scheme would help in increasing agricultural productivity. By this, the farmers would not worry about the uncertainty of production and their income would become stable, by which they would be able to complete the production activity more sincerely.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Problem In India</h2>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley has written in his book</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-image-159 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Huxley-232x300.jpg?resize=232%2C300" alt="Population Problem In India" width="232" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Julian Huxley</p></div>
<p>India’s condition in relation to population problem is very troublesome. If, India is unable to find a solution to the problem of population, a big political and soda distortion may arise. But, if, it succeeds it would not only get the lead in Asia but (due to wide market) become the center of attraction of the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of population can be solved by the economic development of the country. To curb the increase in population following suggestions can be implemented.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Population Explosion In India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/causes-of-population-explosion-in-india/">Causes of Population Explosion in India</a><br />
<span id="more-158"></span></p>
<h3>Proposed Solutions to Population Problem in India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Strict Implementation of the Rules of Marriage</h4>
<p>Presently the marriageable age for boys and girls under the law is 21 and 18 years, respectively. This should be strictly followed. The parents forbidding this rule must be punished suitably.</li>
<li>
<h4>Reduce the Birth Rate</h4>
<p>To control the birth rate, it is necessary to propagate birth control devices, educating the people, creating profitable job opportunities for them and increasing the living standard of people by this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Propagating Women’s Education</h4>
<p>According to Dr. Alka Cohosh</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s education is necessary in the direction of curbing the rapid increase in population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In- this context the knowledge of family planning should be included in the school syllabus for girls at secondary level.</li>
<li>
<h4>Moral Restraint</h4>
<p>The educational organisations should compulsorily provide moral education. Birth rate reduces by moral restraint. Moral restraint includes late marriage, bachelorhood and living in restraint manner etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tax Relief and Other Benefits</h4>
<p>To make family planning more popular some tax reliefs and other attractions should be given. Unmarried and childless people must be given tax reliefs.</li>
<li>
<h4>Mobile Hospitals</h4>
<p>The state government should arrange mobile hospitals, which should contain all the medicines relating to family planning and other devices and accessories for distribution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Discourage Large Families</h4>
<p>With the object to discourage large families, higher taxes should be imposed on them and tax rebates be offered to small families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Superstitions</h4>
<p>By making the village people more educated, efforts should be made to eliminate their superstitions. Family planning scheme should be approved by the village head or Sar-Panch because on his advice more and more people of the village would follow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Advertising</h4>
<p>For this program, films, songs, speeches, discussions and distribution of advertising material should, be used and the Panchayats and social service organisations must be assisted in this work. People’s attitude will have to be changed for the success of family planning program.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Explosion In India</h2>
<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics. Death rate has become controlled due to modern health and medical facilities and it has reduced to become 15 persons per thousand whereas; birth rate has not got any significant reduction. That is why; this period from 1951 to 1981 is known in India as the period of <strong>Population Explosion.</strong></p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Effect of Population Explosion on Economic Development of India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/?p=158&amp;preview=true">Suggestions To Solve Population Problem</a><br />
<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<h3>Causes of Population Explosion In India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Hot Climate<img class="size-medium wp-image-143 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/population-300x169.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="Causes of Population Explosion" width="300" height="169" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h4>
<p>One of the reasons of fast rising population in India is its hot climate. Due to hot climate, maturity comes at early age in boys and girls, due to which they give birth to their children at their early age. This is one of the main reasons for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Child Marriage and Multi Marriage System</h4>
<p>In India the tradition of child marriage and multi-marriage system is prevalent. Marriage of around 80% girls of the country is took place at their young age of between 15 to 20 years. Thus, the result of long married life comes in the farm of excessive childbirth. Tradition of multi-marriage system increases the rotation of childbirth. Apart from it, the increasing tendency of widow marriage, due to the social reforms is also increasing childbirth up to some extent.</li>
<li>
<h4>Religious Superstitions</h4>
<p>Our religious Gurus say that if a Hindu person does not has son, then who will perform the religious ritual in its absence. Due to this, person remains engage in the continuous process of giving birth, one by one, in search of male baby. In the same manner, in Muslims both male and female child is a boon (gift) sent by Allah, prevention of their birth by using any means of family planning is a sin. Due to these reasons, population is continuously increasing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Unawareness</h4>
<p>In India around 36% males and 61% females are illiterate. Neither they have full knowledge of family planning nor they know about the consequences of excessive childbirth. This is one of the reasons of rising population and the situation of Population Explosion’ is emerged.</li>
<li>
<h4>Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to poverty, population is increased of the poor families of our country. People lives in slum, uses their children as a tool, to earn money, hence they always try to increase the number of children in their families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Birth Rate</h4>
<p>In India the average age for marriage is very low, comparatively other nations of the world. This is also a reason for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Death Rate</h4>
<p>In India the death rate from the year 1900 to 1910 was around 35 to 50 persons per thousand, which is now reduced to only 7 to 8 persons per thousand. This become ‘possible in the country by good and hygienic food, pure drinking water, facilities of hospitals, good cleanness, medical facilities at affordable rates and control over Malnutrition, Pneumonia, Cholera, Epidemic etc. Along with, child death rate has reduced to 69 per thousand, comparatively around 218 per thousand in between the years 1916 to 1920. Due to this also, the position of Population Explosion occurred.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indifferent towards Family Planning</h4>
<p>Illiterate persons and people living in rural areas are indifferent towards family planning. They feel fear even by the name of ‘Operation’. They are not interested even in the use of simplest and cheapest means of family planning.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Social Security</h4>
<p>Due to lack of social security system in India, every parent seeks. shelter at the time of crises and for their old age, in childbirth. Whether this would be son or daughter. In the fear of death of their child at childhood, they give birth too many children, so that any of them would be support of their old age.</li>
<li>
<h4>Arrival of Refugees</h4>
<p>Population is very much increased due to continuous arrivals of refugees in India. At the time of division of India and. Pakistan in 1947, more than 1 crore refugees came to India. In 1962 at the time of attack of China, a huge number of Tibetan refugees came to India. Similarly, in 1971, more than 1 crore Bangladeshi refugees, came to India and even today this problem is still continued. Apart from this, continuous arrival of Nepalis, is also still continued. More than 5 lakhs Tamil refugees had come to India due to Sri Lankan Tamil problem. All these are responsible for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Other Causes</h4>
<p>Apart from the above, following are other causes of population explosion<br />
1- Social compulsion of Marriage<br />
2- Lack of means of entertainment<br />
3- Bhagyawati (fateful) view<br />
4- Ambition of big family<br />
5- Betterment in economic position<br />
6- Joint family system, etc.</li>

<h5>Is India over-populated? A critical examination of the present population policy.</h5>
<h3>POPULATION EXPLOSION</h3>

<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics. Death rate has become controlled due to modern health and medical facilities and it has reduced to become 15 persons per thousand whereas; birth rate has not got any significant reduction. That is why; this period from 1951 to 1981 is known in India as the period of <strong>Population Explosion.</strong></p>

<span id="more-128"></span></p>
<h3>Population Explosion And Economic Development</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, with an increase in population, production also increases and the number of those people also increases, among whom the total increase in production is distributed. Thus, the ultimate effect of increase in population on the level of production per head, would be indifferent or negative. This would depend on the form of increase in population and its directions. If the increase is in the number of dependents, then in place of production, consumers would increase and ultimately the effect on per head production would be adverse. On the contrary, in case of favorable age constitution of the population, its effect on the economic development would be better.</p>
<h3>EFFECTS OF THE INCREASING POPULATION IN INDIA ON ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH</h3>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has adversely affected the economic development and economy, which is clear from the following facts</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>Due to the increasing population, the rate of development has been slow. Whereas; the growth rate of Japan during the previous 10 years has been 15%, while the average growth rate of India has been 4% only.</li>
<li>
<h4>Widespread Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to heavy population the benefit of economic development is almost nil in the country. Though during the last 30 years there has been an increase of 15% in the national income, still the per ca-pita income has increased ‘50% only. About 50% of the population of the country is below the poverty line. Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/poverty-problem-india/">Problem of Poverty in India</a></li>
<li>
<h4>High Prices</h4>
<p>Due to higher population we find scarcity everywhere and due to scarcity, the prices are heading towards an increase. The country has scarcity of food-grains, scarcity of employment, scarcity of essentials, scarcity of houses, scarcity of oil etc..</li>
<li>
<h4>Excess Burden on the Economy</h4>
<p>The 1.5 crore of increase in the population each year is increasing the burden on the Indian economy.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problems in Industrialization</h4>
<p>Our country has poverty and unemployment only due to higher population. The level of savings and investments is lower and mechanization is discouraged due to excess human resources. The small and cottage industries are primary. Due to all these reasons rapid industrialization has not become possible. The slow pace of capital formation is also a hurdle in <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrialization in India.</a></li>
<li>
<h4>Expenditure on Population Control</h4>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has forced expenditure of crores of rupees on population control under planned development. These resources would otherwise have been used in the economic development of the country and the standard of living would have improved.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Unemployment</h4>
<p>The means of employment do not increase at the same rate as the increase in population, as a result the existing <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">problem of unemployment</a> becomes more dreadful. This is the reason for continuous increase in unemployment in India. At the beginning of the first plan, the numbers of unemployed were 35 millions which increased to 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Food-gains</h4>
<p>Due to the rapid increase in population, to fulfill the requirements of the population since several years, millions of tons of food-grains has to be imported. This has adversely affected the foreign trade.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of the Increasing Number of Dependents</h4>
<p>Rapid increase in population increases the burden of number of dependents. According to the 1961 census 47.3% of the population was dependent which increased today to 71.1%.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Capital Formation</h4>
<p>The increase in income due to the economic development is expended in catering to the needs of the increased population, as a result capital formation cannot be increased and investment rate remains lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Hinders the Growth of Agriculture and Industry</h4>
<p>Increasing population hinders the quick development of agriculture.<br />
It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdivision of land reduces the area of land per person</li>
<li>The burden of population on agriculture increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the increasing population hinders the growth of industry also. Rapid increase in population decreases the savings and investment rates. During lack of capital, the pace of industrial development is slow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase In the Burden of Public Utility Services</h4>
<p>For the rapid increase in population, the government has to incur more on housing, education, health, welfare, law and order and security. Thus, funds for development work fall short.</li>
