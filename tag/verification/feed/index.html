								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have already discussed about purpose and objectives of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking/">Routine Checking</a>. In this article we will go through some merits and demerits of <em>Routine Checking</em>.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-196"></span></p>
<h2>Merits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Mathematical Accuracy</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg?resize=300%2C116" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The mathematical mistakes of the books of accounts are known from this type of checking, it confirms that the accounts are mathematically accurate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is very easy. It can be done even by a person of ordinary abilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Basis of Final Checking</h4>
<p>It also helps in the checking of Trial Balance and Final Accounts. In fact, it is the basis of checking of Final Accounts, on which basis the auditor prepares his report.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowledge of Errors and Frauds</h4>
<p>Through this, the errors, frauds and misappropriation of accounts are known.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowing Errors in Posting</h4>
<p>Generally, the chances of mistake are more in ledger, in accounting work. By routine checking it can be known, whether the work of ledger posting is done properly or not.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tracing out Change in Figures</h4>
<p>Various secret Ticks and Marks are used during the process. If any change is made in figures after the checking, it can be easily traced.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demerits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Carelessness in Work</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is not of any specific ability, thus, it is done by junior employees. These junior employees take routine check as a mere formality and finish the work quickly and carelessly, due to which chances of various mistakes remaining undetected are there. In fact, this fault is not of routine check but of the persons doing the work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Errors of Principle remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Persons doing routine checking are not much qualified, thus they do not have full knowledge of the Principles of Accounting. Thus, the errors of principle of accounting remain undetected.</li>
<li>
<h4>Monotonous Work</h4>
<p>Since, the work of routine checking goes on in a continuous process, the employees get bored in their work and they don’t take interest in their work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cleverly done Frauds remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Small mathematical and other inaccuracies can be known through this technique, but cleverly and intelligently planned big frauds cannot be known.</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Meaning Of Internal Check</h2>
<p>Internal check system is a part of the internal control system of the business. This is also called <em>Internal Block</em>. Each trader wants that he should be able to control the internal activities of his business, in such a manner that he can get maximum profits and the. chances of mistakes, fraud, etc., are could be minimum. The system of internal check is one such arrangement, in which the activities of employees are divided in such a manner that the work of one employee is independently checked by the other employee. Unless all employees of the organisation are become united, the chances of fraud etc., is not there.</p>
<p><span id="more-91"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-medium wp-image-265" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/internal-check-300x202.jpg?resize=300%2C202" alt="Internal Check" width="300" height="202" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">Internal Check</p></div>
<p>For example – Suppose a customer presents a cheque of ₹1000 to the bank for payment. If all the works of checking the cheque, its investigation, its entry in books of accounts and payment of that cheque are done by a single bank employee, then he can by increasing a zero in ₹1000, make it ₹10000 in the bank books, give payment of ₹1000 only to the customer and can keep himself inappropriately the balance of ₹9000.</p>
<p>If the work of encashment of cheques is divided among three employees, one shall investigate the cheque, and make entries in the books of accounts. Second employee shall check this entry and send it to the third employee making cheque payments. The third employee shall make payment to the customer. In this system a single work is divided among three persons, and the work of first employee is automatically (without any special efforts) checked by the second employee, and the third employee shall make the payment of ₹1000 written in the cheque. In such a case, misappropriation cannot happen, unless all three employees unite.</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>According to Spicer and Pegler</p>
<blockquote><p>The internal check is such a system of management of a business, in which the work which is to be done by the employees is divided by the organisation in such a manner, that no employee can do the written accounting work of a transaction from the beginning to the end, and the work of each employee is also surely and independently checked by another employee, so that without any joint and pre-planned efforts of all employees, the happening of mistakes and frauds becomes impossible, and if any mistake occurs, it is immediately detected at the time of accounting, by another employee.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Verification Of Assets</h2>
<p>For verification of any assets the auditor has to mainly check some general points, which are almost similar for all kinds of assets, still according to the name of the asset, the auditor verifies them in the following manner</p>
<p>The main parameters to verify the value of an asset are</p>
<ul>
<li>Debtors</li>
<li>Goodwill</li>
<li>Trade Mark</li>
<li>Land and Buildings</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-87"></span></p>
<h5>Debtors</h5>
<p>The auditor should verify this asset carefully because it- might be that full amount has been received from a debtor, but the whole amount is not shown as a receipt and some portion of that amount is shown as discount to debtor and that amount of discount has been fraudulently stolen by the firm by not giving this discount to debtors. This may also be possible that cash may be received from debtor but it is not deposited in his account and theft, and the debt of that person (debtor) is shown as a Bad Debt and written off from Profit and Loss account. The auditor shall verify this asset in the following manner.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Attaining the List</h6>
<p>The auditor shall attain a certified list of total debtors of the firm, from a responsible officer. He shall also attain the necessary documents and receipts of debtors relating to total amount of bad debts.</li>
<li>
<h6>Communication with the Debtors</h6>
<p>If the auditor considers it necessary, he shall communicate with the debtors independently and confirm whether. The amount remaining in balance at the end of the year is also according to their books or not.</li>
<li>
<h6>Checking Bad Debts and Discount to Debtors</h6>
<p>The auditor should see that discount to debtors is given as per the rules and which officer is authorised to give, this rebate. He should also see whether on each discount, the signature of that officer is present or not. Similarly, if for any loan it seems that it is not recoverable and it is written as a Bad debt, the auditor should also check that the officer who has written it, in Bad Debts account was authorised to do so, or not, because it is possible that after showing it as a Bad Debt, the loan was recovered from the debtor and distributed between the officer and the debtor, fraudulently.</li>
<li>
<h6>Checking of Securities</h6>
<p>If any cash loan is given by the organisation by taking some security, then such securities should also be checked.</li>
<li>
<h6>Presentation in the Balance Sheet</h6>
<p>The auditor should see whether any special law applies on that organisation, or not. If any special law applies then he should see that according to that law, how the debtors should be shown in the Balance Sheet. As according to the Companies Act, it is compulsory for the company to show its loans under the following heads</p>
<ul>
<li>Loans which are considered receivable and for which the company is fully secured.</li>
<li>Loans which are considered receivable but in relation to which the company does not have any other security other than the personal security of the debtor.</li>
<li>Loans which are considered Bad and Doubtful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If no special law applies on the organisation, the auditor shall see that debtors are shown in a manner as shown in other ordinary business organisations.<br />
An important case relating to showing of debtors in the Balance Sheet, is London &amp; General Bank case. In this case, the auditor of London &amp; General Bank Ltd. was held responsible for breach of duty because he did not reveal this fact to the shareholders of the bank in his report that he has shown various loans as asset (debtors) in the Balance Sheet and interest earned on them also shown in the Profit &amp; Loss account as a profit, whereas; fact was this that the chances of recovery of these loans were almost nil, though the auditor was quite aware of this fact.</p>
<h5>Goodwill</h5>
<p>Goodwill is an intangible asset. If it is separated from business then it has no value. Its value depends on the increase and decrease of the profits of the business. If there is any additional profit in any business then the goodwill of the business is considered big.<br />
Goodwill is a separate asset from other assets of the business, its valuation also cannot be done like other assets-of the business because neither it depreciates, nor it requires reconstruction and repairs, etc., or it needs to be replaced.<br />
Goodwill is valued in an organisation in the following two cases</p>
<ul>
<li>While purchasing a running business, in such a case, the Purchase Price of goodwill is known by deducting net assets from the Purchase Price, i.e., (Goodwill = Purchasing Price — Net Asset). For example, if a running business is purchased for Rs. 100000 and the Purchase Price of the assets of the organisation is Rs. 80000, then the goodwill of that organisation will be, 100000 — 80000 = Rs. 20000.</li>
<li>When a new partner is taken in a partnership or any old partner separates from the business, then a goodwill account is opened, at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both the above cases the following method is adopted for the Verification of Goodwill</p>
<ol>
<li>On purchase of goodwill, the auditor must study the contract with the vendor (seller of goodwill) and see that it is shown at the proper value in the books of accounts or not.</li>
<li>If goodwill arises with admission of a new partner in the business or on separation, then the auditor must see the Partnership Deed.</li>
<li>In the Balance Sheet goodwill must be shown at Cost Price.</li>
<li>Sometimes goodwill is written off, and re-opened due to some reasons. If this is done, then the auditor must study the copy of resolution passed by the directors.</li>
<li>Even after complete investigations, if the auditor is not satisfied with the amount of goodwill, then he should state this clearly in his, report.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Trade Mark</h5>
<p>When a product is registered with a specific symbol so that no other producer is permitted by the law to use that symbol. That product and its manufacturer are also identified by that symbol.<br />
For trade mark, the auditor has to perform the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>If any organisation or its branches has more than one trademarks, the auditor must obtain a list of all trademarks which should contain the details of serial number, date, duration, fees etc.</li>
<li>If trade mark is obtained by paying some amount to another person, the investigation of this payment must be made by the payment receipt, received from him.</li>
<li>If trade mark is such that it is registered for the first time, then the fees paid for registration must be verified from the receipt of the payment made.</li>
<li>If the trade mark is renewed, then the amount paid in renewal should be checked by the receipt which is received against that payment.</li>
<li>The auditor must see the period of trade mark from the Registration certificate attained. The period of a trade mark is usually not more than 14 years. Thus, he should see that during this period, provision for depreciation is provided on trade mark or not. The rate of depreciation should be such that by the time of the expiry of the period of trade mark, it should be fully written off.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Land And Building<img class="size-full wp-image-260 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/building-1-1.jpeg?resize=240%2C160&#038;ssl=1" alt="Verification Parameters" width="240" height="160" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<ol>
<li>If building is purchased, its verification must be done on the basis of the contract.</li>
<li>If building is constructed on contract, it must be verified by the certificates of contractors and experts.</li>
<li>If building is constructed by the employees of the organisation only, then the certificate of the responsible officer must be obtained.</li>
<li>Building must be shown in the Balance Sheet, after deducting appropriate depreciation on it.</li>
<li>The existence of the building should be seen by the auditor himself.</li>
<li>Building must be shown at cost price only. The auditor must see that no profits earned by the organisation, are fraudulently included in this amount.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Meaning Of Verification</h4>
<p>It is the duty of the auditor that he specifically writes in his report whether the financial position of the organisation represented in the Balance Sheet is proper or not. He must make sure that all the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present with the organisation or not, the organisation has valued them properly or not, they are free from all kinds of mortgages etc. or not. Similarly he has &#8216;to make sure about all liabilities also. In this way the auditor evaluates the assets and liabilities of the organisation and verifies them, and this work of the auditor is called <em>Verification</em>.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/verification-parameters/">Verification Parameters</a></p>
<p><span id="more-84"></span></p>
<p>It is clear that verification of assets is such a process by which the auditor certifies that the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are correct. Explaining the complete objective of verification J.R. Batliboi Boy has said that</p>
<blockquote><p>Auditor should satisfy himself that the assets are actually present on the date of Balance Sheet and they are free of any charge or mortgage and their valuation is done in proper manner.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-154 size-medium" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg?resize=300%2C116" alt="Verification of Assets" width="300" height="116" data-recalc-dims="1" />The auditor must take all kinds of care in relation to assets. He should check all documents of title, receipts etc. related to the assets. Mostly these documents of title are with the trader but if they are with some other person like banks etc., then they should be attained from them. He should not show any kind of relaxation in this. In relation to verification of assets, the position of an auditor is specified in a court case that for verification of assets, the auditor should take care of the following points</p>
<ol>
<li>All the assets are included in the Balance Sheet of the organisation and are shown clearly.</li>
<li>Assets are valued properly</li>
<li>On the date of preparation of Balance Sheet the assets were physically present with the organisation.</li>
<li>All the assets were in possession of the organisation and were free from any charge or mortgage.</li>
<li>Assets were owned by the organisation and not by anyone else.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Objectives Of Verification</h4>
<p>The main objective of verification is to check the following<br />
points</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether all assets and liabilities are mathematically accurate or not.</li>
<li>All assets are properly accounted for, as per the rules of the organisation and legal provisions, or not</li>
<li>All the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present or not, and at the time of preparation of Balance Sheet they were present with the organisation, or not.</li>
<li>Any such change.is made in an asset which is not shown in the Balance Sheet. In other words, assets are shown keeping in view all the related provisions, or not.</li>
<li>Whether fictitious Assets are written off adequately, or not.</li>
<li>Valuation of assets and liabilities is done according to the accounting principles or not and valuation is correct according to the previous year, or not.</li>
<li>No fraud or irregularities occurred in relation to the assets and liabilities of the organisation.</li>
<li>All the assets and liabilities of the organisation are shown or not and none is hidden.</li>
<li>Assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present or not and they are owned by the organisation or not. It might be that some assets are not in the possession of the organisation, like &#8211; on taking a loan from bank, the assets or stock of the organisation is kept in the goodwill of the bank. But in such a case, the organisation has legal right over such asset, and it is considered the property of the organisation.</li>
