								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Criticism Of Marshall Definition</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-288 alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg?resize=213%2C300" alt="Alfred Marshall" width="213" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />The <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Dr. Marshall definition of Economics</a> is a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. This definition was recognized between 1890 to 1932 and it seemed that the controversy relating to the definition of Economics had ended. But, a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science&#8217; in 1932 criticized Marshall&#8217;s definition in loud words, which are as follows &#8211;<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Illusion of Anti-Immateriality</h4>
<p>Dr Marshall has restricted the relation of Economics only to the attainment of material resources and its consumption, whereas, Economics also includes the immaterial resources like services of advocates, teachers and other employees. That is the reason Robin said</p>
<blockquote><p>The Economist who keeps in mind only material study, cannot save themselves from the blame of being biased to one aspect.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Vagueness of Ordinary Business Activity</h4>
<p>The phrase used by Dr. Marshall, &#8220;The activities relating to the ordinary business of life is unclear and vague, because it is not cleat, what activities of man corm under ordinary business and winch activities are outside its area.&#8221; According to Prof. Robbins, though there are several such activities which come under an ordinary business of life, yet are studied in Economics, like &#8211; study of economy at the time of war, conditions of Imperfect Competition, Monopoly, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unclear Economic Activities</h4>
<p>Marshall has divided human activities in two parts, Economic and Non-economic, which is unfair because a similar activity of man can be economic and non-economic also at different times. Like &#8211; sweeping his own house by a servant is a non-economic activity, while sweeping his employer&#8217;s house. becomes an economic activity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unfair to Relies Economics with Human Welfare</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins, Economics has no relation with human welfare, Under this, all kind of activities must be studied, whether it is related to human welfare or not. He gives the following arguments to prove this</p>
<ul>
<li>Production and consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants It not ,beneficial for human welfare, still it is studied in Economics.</li>
<li>Human welfare is not a definite idea; It keeps changing according to time, place and conditions.</li>
<li>Human welfare cannot be measured in quantitative terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is not only a Social Science but also Human Science</h4>
<p>Prof. Marshall has restricted the field of Economics, by calling it only a social science. On the contrary, according to Prof. Robbins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is a human science, whose basic rules apply to an insane, miser, sage or Mahatma in the same mariner, as it applies to all the persons living in a society.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>The welfare definitions have restricted the scope of Economics because according to these definitions only material, ordinary and economic activities are studied in Economics. All other activities are outside the scope of Economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is Neutral between Objectives</h4>
<p>According to Robbins, &#8220;Economics is neutral against objectives. Objectives may be good and also bad, but this has no relation with Economics.&#8221; In his book, Prof. Robbins writes, &#8220;Whatever Economics is concerned with; it is not concerned with the causes of material welfare&#8221;.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is a Real Science</h4>
<p>On the basis of the definition of Marshall, Economics has become an ideal science, whereas; according to Robbins, &#8220;<strong>Economics is a real science and not an ideal science</strong>&#8220;.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above criticisms, it is clear that Marshall&#8217;s definition is narrow and unscientific, and is stuck in the net of immateriality.</p>
<p>Even after the above criticisms, Marshall&#8217;s definition is still a source of inspiration, to the readers. Economists, like &#8211; <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/keynesian-theory/">J.M. Keynes</a>, Hyne and Newman etc. consider Marshall yet as a &#8220;Great knowledgeable Economist&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Problem In India</h2>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley has written in his book</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-image-159 size-medium" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Huxley-232x300.jpg?resize=232%2C300" alt="Population Problem In India" width="232" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Julian Huxley</p></div>
<p>Indiaâ€™s condition in relation to population problem is very troublesome. If, India is unable to find a solution to the problem of population, a big political and soda distortion may arise. But, if, it succeeds it would not only get the lead in Asia but (due to wide market) become the center of attraction of the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of population can be solved by the economic development of the country. To curb the increase in population following suggestions can be implemented.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Population Explosion In India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/causes-of-population-explosion-in-india/">Causes of Population Explosion in India</a><br />
<span id="more-158"></span></p>
<h3>Proposed Solutions to Population Problem in India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Strict Implementation of the Rules of Marriage</h4>
<p>Presently the marriageable age for boys and girls under the law is 21 and 18 years, respectively. This should be strictly followed. The parents forbidding this rule must be punished suitably.</li>
<li>
<h4>Reduce the Birth Rate</h4>
<p>To control the birth rate, it is necessary to propagate birth control devices, educating the people, creating profitable job opportunities for them and increasing the living standard of people by this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Propagating Womenâ€™s Education</h4>
<p>According to Dr. Alka Cohosh</p>
<blockquote><p>Womenâ€™s education is necessary in the direction of curbing the rapid increase in population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In- this context the knowledge of family planning should be included in the school syllabus for girls at secondary level.</li>
<li>
<h4>Moral Restraint</h4>
<p>The educational organisations should compulsorily provide moral education. Birth rate reduces by moral restraint. Moral restraint includes late marriage, bachelorhood and living in restraint manner etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tax Relief and Other Benefits</h4>
<p>To make family planning more popular some tax reliefs and other attractions should be given. Unmarried and childless people must be given tax reliefs.</li>
<li>
<h4>Mobile Hospitals</h4>
<p>The state government should arrange mobile hospitals, which should contain all the medicines relating to family planning and other devices and accessories for distribution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Discourage Large Families</h4>
<p>With the object to discourage large families, higher taxes should be imposed on them and tax rebates be offered to small families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Superstitions</h4>
<p>By making the village people more educated, efforts should be made to eliminate their superstitions. Family planning scheme should be approved by the village head or Sar-Panch because on his advice more and more people of the village would follow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Advertising</h4>
<p>For this program, films, songs, speeches, discussions and distribution of advertising material should, be used and the Panchayats and social service organisations must be assisted in this work. Peopleâ€™s attitude will have to be changed for the success of family planning program.</li>
