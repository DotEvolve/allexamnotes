								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>IMPORTANCE OR BENEFITS OF THE LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility/">Law of Equi-Marginal Utility</a> has an important place in economics. Even though it is highly <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-criticism-and-limitation/">criticized</a>, its importance cannot be ignored. This applies in the every field of economics, which is clear from the following<br />
<span id="more-432"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Consumption</h4>
<p>This law is very important in the field of consumption because every consumer wants to get maximum satisfaction from his limited income. Along with those goods which consumers are consuming presently; they also keep goods for future consumption, so that they can get equal utility at both the times.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Fieid of Production</h4>
<p>Usually, producer has capital in a limited quantity but he wants to get maximum profit from his investment (Capital) and it is possible only when the production cost would be less and production would be more. So, the producer uses the cheap and more production giving means (factors of production), at the place of expensive means, until marginal productivity of both the means become equal. In this way, law of Equi-marginal Utility is also applicable in the field of production.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Fieldof Exchange</h4>
<p>The main basis of exchange, is this law, because in exchange, goods are purchased and told through money and in every exchange, we compare the utility receiving with utility, giving in return. We keep trying to exchange up to that extent, unless the utility giving become equal, to the utility received. Thus, law equi-marginal Utility is the basis of exchange.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Distribution</h4>
<p>In the field of distribution, this law is helpful in distributing the remuneration in factors of production. National income is distributed in Land, Labour, Capital and Organisation. Share of factors of production is determined according to their marginal productivity. Hence, the producer uses that particular factor more; the marginal productivity of which is more, than its remuneration.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Public Finance</h4>
<p>In the field of public finance also, this law has very importance. The Principle of Maxirrtum Social Advantage is also based on the Law of qui marginal Utility Government charges more tax from rich and charges less tax from poor people and spend that income in such a ipisray that the poor can get more benefit in comparison to rich persons.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>It is clear from the above analysis that Law of equi-marginal Utility is an important basic law of Economics and it is used at wide level. According to Marshall</p>
<blockquote><p>This law is applicable in almost every field of economic research.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Measurement of Utility</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/utility/">Utility</a> is a Psychological and Personal Concept. There is a deference of opinion, whether measurement of utility can be done or not. Followings are the two approaches are prevalent in this regard.<br />
<span id="more-413"></span></p>
<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CARDINAL APPROACH AND ORDINAL APPROACH</h4>
<h3>CARDINAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>The economist Marshal and Pigou etc. have their view that utility can measured in the form of moneys According to them, a person will agree to pay for a commodity; just equal to the utility, which he derives from that commodity. If a person is willing to spend more for a commodity, it means that he gaining more (excessive or surplus) utility from that commodity. In this way, it can be said that price to be given for a commodity is a measurement of that commodity. For example, if a person is ready to pay 10 rupees for a coffee, the utility of that coffee for that person Will be equal to 10 rupees. Hence, it is clear from the above example that according to Prof. Marshall, the utility of a commodity can be expressed through Cardinal Numbers like 1,2,3,4 etc. When we express the utility of a commodity in this manner, it is called Ordinal Utility and this approach is Called <em>Cardinal Approach</em>. In other words, according to this approach, utility can be measured.</p>
<h3>ORDINAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>Contrary to above approach, some economists such as Perito, Ellen, Hicks etc. do not agree with approach of Prof. Marshall and Prof. Pigou. According to these economists, utility cannot be measured. These economists criticized cardinal approach of Marshall, on the basis of following points</p>
<ol>
<li>Utility is a psychological concept, which cannot be measured in the form of money.</li>
<li>Utility remains unstable.</li>
<li>Money is not the correct measurement of utility because the -value of money keeps changing itself.</li>
<li>The amount of money, which we are ready to pay to purchase a commodity, it shows only the estimated utility of the commodity, not the actual utility.</li>
<li>Money is not correct measurement of utility on the following ground also that if a poor man is unable to purchase a cycle, how we can say that there is no utility in cycle for him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prof. Pigou, who was supporter of Marshall&#8217;s approach earlier; accepted later that only intensity of desire can be measured by money, utility cannot be measured. Due to these difficulties&#8217; Prof. Hicks and other economist have finally accepted that utility cannot be measured and they developed a new method of analysis, <strong>Indifference curve analysis</strong> at the place of <em>Utility analysis</em>, in which there is no need to measure utility. In this method, only Ordinal Numbers 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th (serial order) are given for utility. In this way, the utility of shirt is more or less than that of bread is expressed by these serial numbers. Unit of utility has no meaning in Ordinal Approach. When measurement of utility of commodity is made, numbers are arranged in a serial order of their importance, such as, &#8216;First&#8217;, *Seconds and Third&#8217; etc.. For Example &#8211; three students getting highest numbers in a class are shown in an Ordinal Serial order of &#8216;First&#8217;, &#8216;Second&#8217;, and &#8216;Third&#8217;. When utility is given ordinal numbers, it is called Ordinal Utility and this approach is called <em>Ordinal Approach</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction to Micro Economics</h3>
<p>In the present times, the study of economics is done from two viewpoints namely <em>Micro</em> and <em>Macro</em>. From the first viewpoint, the economic problems of various units, like &#8211; individuals, families, firms etc. are studied individually, whereas; from the second viewpoint, the same units of persons, families, firms etc., are studied in a combined form. Micro Economics is concerned with a specific, particular or an individual whereas; Macro Economics is concerned with a <em>group</em>.</p>
<h3>Meaning</h3>
<p>The word <em>micro </em>means very small portion. From this point of view, micro economics is the study of specific economics units of the whole economy. Under this, a commodity, a consumer, a firm or an industry is studied individually.<br />
<span id="more-351"></span></p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>According to Kenneth E. Boulding,</p>
<blockquote><p>In micro economics, particular firms, particular families, individual prices, wages, incomes, particular industries and specific commodities are studied.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Historical Background</h4>
<p>Prof. <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/tag/adam-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Smith</a> is called the father of micro economics but its development was done by Prof. <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/tag/alfred-marshall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfred Marshall</a> and his companions.</p>
<h2>Importance and Merits of Micro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Correct knowledge of the nature of individual units</h4>
<p>It makes analytical study of individual units, which helps in understanding the nature of economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in the determination of economic policies</h4>
<p>It provides significant contribution in the determination of individual economic policies.</li>
<li>
<h4>Helpful in solving economic problems</h4>
<p>It helps in providing solutions to the economic problems of individual units by studying their economic nature.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations and Demerits of Micro Economics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Ignore the whole</h4>
<p>It ignores the whole economy and studies only the small parts of the economy. Due to this, it does not represent the correct form of the whole economy.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unsuitable in many areas</h4>
<p>There are many areas of economic analysis, where the use of micro economics is unsuitable. In the fields like, international trade, national income, national savings, nation -investments etc. There is limited use micro economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unrealistic assumption</h4>
<p>The assumption that the laws of micro economics are also applicable on macro-economics is not correct because it is not necessary that what is appropriate for an individual concern is also appropriate for the whole economy. For example, by the point of view of an employment, it is good for a person and a country that a person of that country is employed at a high post but if each individual of that country is employed at high posts, then it would become a curse for the murky. This is because if even a small activity of daily life is hindered, it would disturb the whole country, like; lack of sweeper in a country would make that country a dust-bin.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Similarities Between The Definition Of Marshall And Robbins</h2>
<p>The following similarities are found in the definitions Of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Prof Marshall</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">Prof Robbins</a><span id="more-332"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Prof. Marshall used the word &#8216;wealth&#8217;, in his definition, whereas; Prof. Robbins has related Economics with &#8216;limited means&#8217; (or scarcity). Therefore, there is similarity in the views of both because wealth is that object or service, whose supply is limited. Thus, Prof. Robbins limited resource (scarcity) statement, is another form of money.</li>
<li>Both the intellectuals consider Economics as a science. In this way, there is similarity in the views of Marshall and Robbins on this matter.</li>
<li>According to Prof Robbins, the utilization of resources must be done economically, so that production or satisfaction becomes maximum. Marshall has expressed the same view, as &#8216;material welfare&#8217; or &#8216;human welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>The ancient Economists had considered Economics as the Science of Wealth, which was interpreted as man is for money, instead of that money is for man. In this manner, the main subject matter of Economics was considered, as wealth and not man. Marshall used the word &#8216;Mankind&#8217; and Robbins used words like &#8216;Human Behavior&#8217;, clearly stated that in Economics, man has an important place instead of wealth.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Differences Between The Definition Of Marshall And Robbins</h2>
<p>The definitions of Prof. Marshall and Prof. Robbins have the following dissimilarities</p>
<ol>
<li>Marshall definition is simple and an. ordinary person. can easily understand it. From this point of view, it is practical, but Robbins definition is so much theoretical, that is why, it is very difficult and beyond the understanding power of ordinary people.</li>
<li>According to Prof. Marshall, Economics has a close relation with &#8216;Human Welfare&#8217;, whereas; according to Robbins, Economics is not related to any &#8216;Welfare&#8217; or &#8216;Non-welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>Marshall presented Economics in the form of both a science and an art, but Robbins accepted it only in the form of a real science.</li>
<li>Marshall has considered Economics as a &#8216;social science&#8217;. According to him, it studies only the activities of social, normal and real persons, whereas; according to Robbins, it studies the both socialistic and sole (aloof), in this way, it is a human science.</li>
<li>Marshall has said that Economics studies only those activities, which are related to wealth and which can be measured in money, whereas; Robbins has said that Economics also studies those activities, which have no relation which money, like &#8211; the study of activities related to &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Which Definition is Superior?</h3>
<p>It is difficult to say which definition between Marshall&#8217;s and Robbins is superior. Actually both definitions are complementary to each other. Marshall&#8217;s definition is easier having a practical view, whereas; Robbins definition has theoretical view point. Both Economists have seen the same thing, from different angles. In Marshall&#8217;s view, wealth is in the form of prime means, whereas; Prof. Robbins has taken in his views, &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;, instead of &#8216;wealth&#8217;. From theoretical point of view, if, Robbins definition is superior, while from practical point of view, Marshall&#8217;s definition is superior.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction Of Robbins</h3>
<div id="attachment_319" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-image-319 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/robbins-1-1.jpg" alt="Robbins definition of Economics" width="220" height="289" /><p id="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-caption-text">Prof Lionel Robbins</p></div>
<p>Robbins definition of Economics challenged Dr.<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/"> Marshall definition of Economics</a> which was a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. Before Prof. Lionel Robbins, Prof. Marshall tried to give complete and faultless definition of economics. At that time people started thinking that the Economic Science has completely develop and matured. But in 1932, after the publication of Prof. Robbins&#8217;s book <strong><em>An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Social Science</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">a controversy roused in the field of Economics</a>. He tried to give economics another shape, apart from material welfare. In the words of Robbins</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relation between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<h2>Characteristics Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p>Following are the main characteristics of Robbins&#8217; definition</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unlimited Wants</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins definition, human wants are unlimited. On satisfaction of one wants, another want arises immediately.and this sequence continues forever.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scarce Means</h4>
<p>Robbins definition stated that through on one side human needs are unlimited yet on the other side, the means to satisfy these wants, like- time, power, money etc. are also limited. Due to this, many of man&#8217;s needs remain unsatisfied.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alternative Use of Scarce Means</h4>
<p>In Robbins&#8217;s view though the to &#8216;satisfy man&#8217;s needs are scarce, yet he has alternative uses. In other words, he can use every resource in various objectives and activities. For example &#8211; such a resource like land can be use in many ways, such as it can be used for agriculture or for building a house or to established a factory etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Variation in the Intensity of wants</h4>
<p>Robbins definition states that the intensity of man&#8217;s needs is different. Some wants are more intense than the others. Since our means are limited and all wants cannot be satisfied with the limited means; as a result, we have to select some more intense wants from our unlimited wants and the less intense wants have to be either dropped or postponed to a future date.</li>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-288 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg" alt="Alfred Marshall" width="213" height="300" />The <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Dr. Marshall definition of Economics</a> is a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. This definition was recognized between 1890 to 1932 and it seemed that the controversy relating to the definition of Economics had ended. But, a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science&#8217; in 1932 criticized Marshall&#8217;s definition in loud words, which are as follows &#8211;<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Illusion of Anti-Immateriality</h4>
<p>Dr Marshall has restricted the relation of Economics only to the attainment of material resources and its consumption, whereas, Economics also includes the immaterial resources like services of advocates, teachers and other employees. That is the reason Robin said</p>
<blockquote><p>The Economist who keeps in mind only material study, cannot save themselves from the blame of being biased to one aspect.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Vagueness of Ordinary Business Activity</h4>
<p>The phrase used by Dr. Marshall, &#8220;The activities relating to the ordinary business of life is unclear and vague, because it is not cleat, what activities of man corm under ordinary business and winch activities are outside its area.&#8221; According to Prof. Robbins, though there are several such activities which come under an ordinary business of life, yet are studied in Economics, like &#8211; study of economy at the time of war, conditions of Imperfect Competition, Monopoly, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unclear Economic Activities</h4>
<p>Marshall has divided human activities in two parts, Economic and Non-economic, which is unfair because a similar activity of man can be economic and non-economic also at different times. Like &#8211; sweeping his own house by a servant is a non-economic activity, while sweeping his employer&#8217;s house. becomes an economic activity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unfair to Relies Economics with Human Welfare</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins, Economics has no relation with human welfare, Under this, all kind of activities must be studied, whether it is related to human welfare or not. He gives the following arguments to prove this</p>
<ul>
<li>Production and consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants It not ,beneficial for human welfare, still it is studied in Economics.</li>
<li>Human welfare is not a definite idea; It keeps changing according to time, place and conditions.</li>
<li>Human welfare cannot be measured in quantitative terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is not only a Social Science but also Human Science</h4>
<p>Prof. Marshall has restricted the field of Economics, by calling it only a social science. On the contrary, according to Prof. Robbins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is a human science, whose basic rules apply to an insane, miser, sage or Mahatma in the same mariner, as it applies to all the persons living in a society.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>The welfare definitions have restricted the scope of Economics because according to these definitions only material, ordinary and economic activities are studied in Economics. All other activities are outside the scope of Economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is Neutral between Objectives</h4>
<p>According to Robbins, &#8220;Economics is neutral against objectives. Objectives may be good and also bad, but this has no relation with Economics.&#8221; In his book, Prof. Robbins writes, &#8220;Whatever Economics is concerned with; it is not concerned with the causes of material welfare&#8221;.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is a Real Science</h4>
<p>On the basis of the definition of Marshall, Economics has become an ideal science, whereas; according to Robbins, &#8220;<strong>Economics is a real science and not an ideal science</strong>&#8220;.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above criticisms, it is clear that Marshall&#8217;s definition is narrow and unscientific, and is stuck in the net of immateriality.</p>
<p>Even after the above criticisms, Marshall&#8217;s definition is still a source of inspiration, to the readers. Economists, like &#8211; <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/keynesian-theory/">J.M. Keynes</a>, Hyne and Newman etc. consider Marshall yet as a &#8220;Great knowledgeable Economist&#8221;</p>

<h3>Introduction Of Marshall</h3>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 223px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-image-288 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg" alt="Principle Of Economics" width="213" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Alfred Marshall</p></div>
<p>Marshall definition of Economics was first to challenge Adam Smith definition. Dr. Alfred Marshall (Born. 26 July, 1842, Died 13 July 1924) was the first Economist, who denied the wealth related definitions of Adam Smith, which was in vogue for a long time, in his two books published in 1890 named <strong>Principles of Economics</strong> and <strong>Economics of Industry</strong>, and declared them wrong, and defined it as not the study of human welfare. He gave, &#8216;Man&#8217; the first place and Wealth&#8217; as secondary and clarified that wealth is for man and man is not for wealth. Wealth is not the &#8216;End&#8217;, it is only a &#8216;Means&#8217; to attain welfare. He presented the definition of Economics in this manner in his book &#8216;Economics of Industry&#8217;.</p>
<p>However Marshall definition was also <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">criticized</a> later by a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science</a>&#8216; in 1932.<br />
<span id="more-287"></span></p>
<h2>Marshall Definition Of Economics</h2>
<p>Economics is the study of human activities in the ordinary course of business. It studies how man attains his income and how he utilizes it. In this way, it studies wealth, on one hand and on the other hand, it is a part of the study of man, which is more important.<br />
According to this definition, it becomes the science of human activities instead of science of wealth. In his second book, &#8216;Principles of Economics&#8217;, Dr. Marshall defined it in these words</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the study of humans, in relation to the ordinary business of life. It studies that portion of the personal and social activities, which are closely related to the attainment of material resources, related to welfare and its utilization.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Characteristics Of Marshall&#8217;s Definition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Greater Emphasis on Human Aspect</h4>
<p>Marshall has given a balanced importance to <em>Means</em> and <em>Ends</em>, through his definition. He has stated in clear words, that it is on one hand is the study of wealth and on the other hand, more important to this is the study of human aspect. In this way, he removed the defect of ignorance of human aspect, in the old views of Adam Smith&#8217;s time, and gave more emphasis to human aspect in clear words.</li>
<li>
<h4>Material Welfare</h4>
<p>Marshall in his definition gave more importance to the means of material gains or material welfare. According to him, it studies, those material resources, on which welfare depends. In this a way, Marshall accepted the material welfare aspect. Other famous economists like &#8211; Pigou, Cannon, Beveridge etc. also supported it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of Social, Normal and Real Persons</h4>
<p>According to Marshall, economics studies only social, normal and real persons. The study of persons living outside the society or in forests, who-are unusual, alone and abnormal, is not done in it. The activities of unusual persons like &#8211; an insane, a miser, a saint or Mahatma etc. are said to be outside the area of the subject Matter of economics. According to Marshall, it studies the economic activities of only the social, normal and real persons.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of the Ordinary Business Activities of Life</h4>
<p>In his definition, Marshall paid emphasis to the <em>Ordinary Business Activities</em>. These &#8216;ordinary business activities&#8217; refers to those economic activities, which are related to the attainment and utilization of wealth. In this manner, Marshall gave a clear place, to human economic activities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Practical Point of View</h4>
<p>Marshall adopted a more practical point of view, in defining economics, He gave equal importance to both theoretical and practical aspects of economic activities, and accepted the scientific and artistic aspects of economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simple and Clear Definition</h4>
<p>The definition given by Marshall is very simple and clear. According to him, economics studies the activities of earning and expending wealth by man.</li>
