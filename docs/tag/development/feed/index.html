								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Marketing</h2>
<p><em>Agricultural marketing refers to all those processes which relate to taking the agricultural product from the farmers to the consumers. Agricultural marketing includes gathering the agricultural produce, their standardization and grading, their storage, sending them to the market through various middlemen, selling in the market and arranging the required finance etc.</em></p>
<h3>Defects/Problems Of Indian Agricultural Marketing</h3>
<p>Even though India is an agricultural country, still its agricultural marketing has been defective. The Indian farmers are unable to get reasonable price for the products even after their hard work and are fully exploited by the middlemen.<span id="more-251"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Too Many Intermediates</h4>
<div id="attachment_252" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252" class="size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fruit_vegetable_market-300x200.jpg" alt="Agricultural Marketing" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-252" class="wp-caption-text">Fruit &amp; Vegetables Market</p></div>
<p>The one main defect of the Indian Agricultural marketing is the presence of too many middlemen and exploitation of farmers by them. On one hand these middlemen exploit the farmers by purchasing the produce at lower prices and on the other hand they exploit the customers by demanding higher prices from them. The only aim of a number of commission agents, brokers etc. is to derive a higher income from the middle processes. These middlemen take undue advantage of the poor former on the basis of their financial resources.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Weights and Scales</h4>
<p>One of the biggest defects of agricultural marketing arises due to weights and scales. Usually, in rural areas bricks, etc. are used as weights and in urban markets also defective weights are found. Thus, the grain of the farmer is weighed by a heavier weight for their own gain. Most of the traders keep separate weights for purchase and sale of grain.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Lack of Unity among Farmers</h4>
<p>The Indian farmers are illiterate who are easier be fooled by the money lenders, traders, middlemen, due to their simple nature. Similarly, lack of unity among farmers also causes their exploitation because Indian farmers are spread in distant areas in rural places. They are unable to meet with each other and resolve their problems, as a result they do not get a fair price for their produce.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Financial Resources</h4>
<p>In the rural areas there is lack of financial resources, due to which even their emergency requirements are not fulfilled. In such conditions the farmers sell their produce before its ripening. Similarly, some financial facilities, like, installments on loans for pumping-set, tractor, thrasher etc. have to be paid on monthly or quarterly basis due to which they have to sell the product as soon as possible. Thus, as the lack of financial assistance, is a problem for the farmers; so does the receipt of loan also puts them in problem.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Organised Marketing System</h4>
<p>The agricultural marketing is also very defective in India because here organised marketing is not in vogue, like, cooperative societies, government marketing activities, regular markets etc. As a result, the farmer remains entangled In exploitation. Thus, lack of organised marketing system is harmful for the farmers. That is -why; the farmer sells his product personally to different people. The middle take full advantage of the unorganized farmers.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Transport Facilities</h4>
<p>The roads from Villages to cities are usually unmade which are not capable of transport during the rainy season. The bullock carts can take the product only up to a limited area. During lack of transport facilities the farmer is unable to take his produce to the appropriate market and is unable to receive a fair price for his product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Store Houses</h4>
<p>An important deficiency of Indian agricultural marketing is lack of store houses. Due to lack of this facility the farmer is unable to keep his product safely until it can fetch a fair price, and he is forced to sell his product at a low price. The insufficient and unscientific facilities of shortage which are available, waste large quantities of grains. Approximately 20% to 30% grains are lost due to rats, insects etc. and the farmers have to bear crores of loss due to lack of these facilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Standardization</h4>
<p>The lack of standardization and grading is clearly visible in the Indian Agricultural marketing, due to which fixing a deal in relation to these products becomes difficult. Due to lack of proper standardization and grading the customers have problem in purchasing the product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Awareness of the Market</h4>
<p>The Indian farmer has no knowledge about marketing. He believes on information acquired from the businessmen and money lenders of the village. Mostly, the Indian farmers are illiterate so they cannot read the newspaper. Thus, they do not have sufficient knowledge about the market. Now, government transmits the rates of the market on the ratio, which has definitely benefited them.</li>
<li>
<h4>Corrupt Policies of the ‘Mandis’</h4>
<p>If we observe the condition of the mandis, this fact is no more hidden that the middlemen and the traders jointly make fool the simple farmers. The Indian Organizing Society has clarified the following facts relating to the corrupt policies of the mandis</p>
<ul>
<li>The inappropriate marketing system is so deep laden in India that about 5% of the amount is deducted from the farmer’s produce in the name of donations, ‘dharmada’, ‘chanda’ etc.</li>
<li>The farmers are paid low price, as they lack appropriate knowledge about market prices, their fluctuations, government policies etc. Thus, by keeping the rates secret, the farmers are cheated.</li>
<li>Before the sale, large amounts of grains are taken from the farmers as samples. By declaring the product to be of sub standard quality minimum prices are paid for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Labor</h2>
<p>Agricultural labor is that person who works on another land, does not participate in farm management and its maintenance, and receives money or a portion of the harvest in consideration for his service. He neither has any rights regarding the land, nor does he have to bear any risk regarding the farm. Briefly by agricultural labor we mean’ such laborers who <em><strong>“earn their livelihood by working on agricultural farms.”</strong></em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Second Agricultural Labor Investigation society</p>
<blockquote><p>Agricultural labor refers to that person who receives more than half of the income from agriculture. The agricultural labor family refers to that family, whose more than half of the income from agriculture.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-233"></span></p>
<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<div id="attachment_234" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" class="size-medium wp-image-234" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agri_labor-300x220.jpg" alt="Agricultural Labor" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Labor</p></div>
<p>Describing the conditions of Indian agricultural labor P.T.Mayya writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Indian laborer spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excess Working Hours</h4>
<p>The working hours of these laborer are not only irregular but also excessive. They have to work since morning to late night. His working hours change with harvest, season and work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Seasonal Employment</h4>
<p>The agricultural labor does not get work for the whole year. According to the Second Agricultural Labor Investigation Society, a Seasonal labor gets an average of 197 days of work in a year. Similarly, child labor gets 204 days and women get 141 days of employment. Thus, their average annual income is very lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Low Wages</h4>
<p>The wage level of agricultural labors very low as compared to that of industrial labor. It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in landless laborers</li>
<li>lack of non-agricultural areas of work in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Agricultural Slavery</h4>
<p>Majority of agricultural laborers are landless and of backward classes. Due to their lower social status they are treated as animals. Big land owners make them work as slaves. They are used as laborers and in return given minimum wages.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indebtedness</h4>
<p>Due to lower income, the indebtedness of agricultural farmers is increasing. They hesitate in negotiating their wages with the land owners in the fear that their services would be terminated. The laborers remain indebted even after working with the land owners for their whole life.</li>
<li>
<h4>Not United</h4>
<p>Since the agricultural laborers are spread in millions of village all over the country they lack unity. Thus, they are unable to negotiate their wages etc. with the land owners by uniting themselves.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Child and Women Laborers</h4>
<p>Due to lower income the children and women of agricultural laborers are also forced to work for their livelihood. The child and women laborers are made to work more for livelihood. Thus, exploitation of child labor and woman labor is a major problem in the field of agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lower Social Status</h4>
<p>Most of the agricultural laborers are of backward classes who have been exploited since centuries. Due to this reason also their social status is lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Other Jobs</h4>
<p>There is shortage of other jobs in villages. Thus, if the crop is destroyed by floods, famines etc., it becomes difficult for the agricultural labor to survive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Housing Problem</h4>
<p>The landless laborers have no private house. They live in cottages, made on the useless land of the landowners with their permission and in its return they have to work without payment, for the landowners. When a number of people live under the same root, the physical, social, moral and religious problem arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment due to mechanization</h4>
<p>At the present times, due to increase in the use of machines, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment</a> rate among the illiterate agricultural farmers is increasing, which is a serious problem for them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Meaning of Poverty</h3>
<p>Poverty refers to that social condition in which a part of the society is unable to fulfill its basic requirements. When a big portion of the population is deprived of the minimum living standard and survives only on the survival level, then it is said that poverty is widely spread in the population.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Poverty in India</h2>
<p>India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70 years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form.<br />
<span id="more-171"></span></p>
<h3>CAUSES OF POVERTY IN INDIA</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>The growth rate of the Indian economy is very low. During the 55 years of the planning period the average growth rate has been 3.5% which has deepened the roots of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mumbai-street-kids.jpg" alt="Unemployment In India" width="250" height="263" /><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Unemployment In India</p></div>
<p>The increasing rate of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment in the country</a> has spread more problem. Due to increasing unemployment, poverty has taken a more serious form. For example, the number of unemployed in the country at the beginning of the first plan was 35 million, which is about 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Political Causes</h4>
<p>The long bondage of the country has slowed the pace of the economy. The foreign invaders took no interest in the development of basic industries. The Zami-dari system started in the country which exploited the farmers completely. Their agricultural policies gave birth to landless farmers and their exploitation. Poverty also increased their exploitation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditional Production Techniques</h4>
<p>In the fields of agriculture and manufacture, the production techniques are traditional which have lowered the production level due to which poverty has increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p>In India inflation has taken an alarming shape. Due to this, people are unable to fulfill the basic requirements of their families. Today 50% of the population of our country is covered under the poor class.</li>
<li>
<h4>Dependency on Agriculture</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India depends on agriculture for their living. Each family has a small amount of land. Everyone live together and live with difficulty on a small land and due to the dependency only on agriculture, the person remains poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alcoholism</h4>
<p>In India, poverty has also increased due to alcoholism. Each day, in India million of people are destroying their money and health due to the habits of alcoholism. Thus, alcoholism is one of the reasons of the increasing this problem in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Belief in Fate</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India give importance to conservative attitude and analyse each aspect on the basis of fate. People become inactive on the thought that it is their fate that is making things happen and live lifelong in the lap of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Adverse Environment and Climate</h4>
<p>On the peaks of Himalayas there is always a snowfall, Rajasthan is also under the same climate in another form. Due to the desert, farming etc. is not possible there and poverty has increased. Thus, the adversity of the environment and the climate has a deep impact on growth of the nation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The places where the land is infertile, there is absence of resources for the production. Coal or iron, minerals etc. are also not available there, people of that place are poor. Due to geographical reasons there are several places in India whose 100% of the population is poor. Like, the land of the hilly areas is not at all fit for agriculture. Moreover, due to lack of resources for agriculture also people are poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Harm by Insects</h4>
<p>The termites attack, the south Indian drops even today and destroy the crops. Moreover, many kinds of insects and rats destroy the wheat, maize, paddy etc., crops. The grains stored by the traders are also destroyed by these insects and rats. On an estimate, about 15 to, 20% of the crops are destroyed by them. Thus, this is also one of the reasons of Indian poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Social Evils</h4>
<p>There are several social evils WI India, like dowry, child marriage, Parda system, etc. which have several bad effects and help in raising poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Industries</h4>
<div id="attachment_172" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172" class="size-medium wp-image-172" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paper-bag-maker-300x200.jpg" alt="Poverty In India" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-172" class="wp-caption-text">Paper bag maker and seller, Varanasi India</p></div>
<p>The industry could not develop properly in India. Due to the lack of industries, poverty can be seen on each side in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Caste System</h4>
<p>Due to caste system people have to carry on their traditional work, even if, they are unprofitable. That is why, the rich people of olden times did not accept small or low grade jobs and instead preferred to die without food, as a result poverty increased in our country.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditions</h4>
<p>Everything is related with religion in India. For the sake of their own customs and traditions, the illiterate people spend thousands of rupees, and take loans for their traditions and stay strangulated in poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unbalanced Growth of Industries</h4>
<p>The opportunity of industrial development came after independence but due to the policies of the British rule the cottage industries could not get protection. This gave rise to unemployment and poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Natural Calamities</h4>
<p>Indian agriculture is dependent on rains, even today. Sometimes, due to less rainfall drought occurs and sometimes due to heavy rainfall crones of rupees of crop is destroyed. These natural calamities have also been responsible for poverty in India.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Problem In India</h2>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley has written in his book</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-image-159 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Huxley-232x300.jpg" alt="Population Problem In India" width="232" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Julian Huxley</p></div>
<p>India’s condition in relation to population problem is very troublesome. If, India is unable to find a solution to the problem of population, a big political and soda distortion may arise. But, if, it succeeds it would not only get the lead in Asia but (due to wide market) become the center of attraction of the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of population can be solved by the economic development of the country. To curb the increase in population following suggestions can be implemented.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">Population Explosion In India</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/causes-of-population-explosion-in-india/">Causes of Population Explosion in India</a><br />
<span id="more-158"></span></p>
<h3>Proposed Solutions to Population Problem in India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Strict Implementation of the Rules of Marriage</h4>
<p>Presently the marriageable age for boys and girls under the law is 21 and 18 years, respectively. This should be strictly followed. The parents forbidding this rule must be punished suitably.</li>
<li>
<h4>Reduce the Birth Rate</h4>
<p>To control the birth rate, it is necessary to propagate birth control devices, educating the people, creating profitable job opportunities for them and increasing the living standard of people by this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Propagating Women’s Education</h4>
<p>According to Dr. Alka Cohosh</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s education is necessary in the direction of curbing the rapid increase in population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In- this context the knowledge of family planning should be included in the school syllabus for girls at secondary level.</li>
<li>
<h4>Moral Restraint</h4>
<p>The educational organisations should compulsorily provide moral education. Birth rate reduces by moral restraint. Moral restraint includes late marriage, bachelorhood and living in restraint manner etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tax Relief and Other Benefits</h4>
<p>To make family planning more popular some tax reliefs and other attractions should be given. Unmarried and childless people must be given tax reliefs.</li>
<li>
<h4>Mobile Hospitals</h4>
<p>The state government should arrange mobile hospitals, which should contain all the medicines relating to family planning and other devices and accessories for distribution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Discourage Large Families</h4>
<p>With the object to discourage large families, higher taxes should be imposed on them and tax rebates be offered to small families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Superstitions</h4>
<p>By making the village people more educated, efforts should be made to eliminate their superstitions. Family planning scheme should be approved by the village head or Sar-Panch because on his advice more and more people of the village would follow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Advertising</h4>
<p>For this program, films, songs, speeches, discussions and distribution of advertising material should, be used and the Panchayats and social service organisations must be assisted in this work. People’s attitude will have to be changed for the success of family planning program.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Population Explosion In India</h2>
<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics. Death rate has become controlled due to modern health and medical facilities and it has reduced to become 15 persons per thousand whereas; birth rate has not got any significant reduction. That is why; this period from 1951 to 1981 is known in India as the period of <strong>Population Explosion.</strong></p>

<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<h3>Causes of Population Explosion In India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Hot Climate<img class="size-medium wp-image-143 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/population-300x169.jpg" alt="Causes of Population Explosion" width="300" height="169" /></h4>
<p>One of the reasons of fast rising population in India is its hot climate. Due to hot climate, maturity comes at early age in boys and girls, due to which they give birth to their children at their early age. This is one of the main reasons for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Child Marriage and Multi Marriage System</h4>
<p>In India the tradition of child marriage and multi-marriage system is prevalent. Marriage of around 80% girls of the country is took place at their young age of between 15 to 20 years. Thus, the result of long married life comes in the farm of excessive childbirth. Tradition of multi-marriage system increases the rotation of childbirth. Apart from it, the increasing tendency of widow marriage, due to the social reforms is also increasing childbirth up to some extent.</li>
<li>
<h4>Religious Superstitions</h4>
<p>Our religious Gurus say that if a Hindu person does not has son, then who will perform the religious ritual in its absence. Due to this, person remains engage in the continuous process of giving birth, one by one, in search of male baby. In the same manner, in Muslims both male and female child is a boon (gift) sent by Allah, prevention of their birth by using any means of family planning is a sin. Due to these reasons, population is continuously increasing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Unawareness</h4>
<p>In India around 36% males and 61% females are illiterate. Neither they have full knowledge of family planning nor they know about the consequences of excessive childbirth. This is one of the reasons of rising population and the situation of Population Explosion’ is emerged.</li>
<li>
<h4>Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to poverty, population is increased of the poor families of our country. People lives in slum, uses their children as a tool, to earn money, hence they always try to increase the number of children in their families.</li>
<li>
<h4>Birth Rate</h4>
<p>In India the average age for marriage is very low, comparatively other nations of the world. This is also a reason for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Death Rate</h4>
<p>In India the death rate from the year 1900 to 1910 was around 35 to 50 persons per thousand, which is now reduced to only 7 to 8 persons per thousand. This become ‘possible in the country by good and hygienic food, pure drinking water, facilities of hospitals, good cleanness, medical facilities at affordable rates and control over Malnutrition, Pneumonia, Cholera, Epidemic etc. Along with, child death rate has reduced to 69 per thousand, comparatively around 218 per thousand in between the years 1916 to 1920. Due to this also, the position of Population Explosion occurred.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indifferent towards Family Planning</h4>
<p>Illiterate persons and people living in rural areas are indifferent towards family planning. They feel fear even by the name of ‘Operation’. They are not interested even in the use of simplest and cheapest means of family planning.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Social Security</h4>
<p>Due to lack of social security system in India, every parent seeks. shelter at the time of crises and for their old age, in childbirth. Whether this would be son or daughter. In the fear of death of their child at childhood, they give birth too many children, so that any of them would be support of their old age.</li>
<li>
<h4>Arrival of Refugees</h4>
<p>Population is very much increased due to continuous arrivals of refugees in India. At the time of division of India and. Pakistan in 1947, more than 1 crore refugees came to India. In 1962 at the time of attack of China, a huge number of Tibetan refugees came to India. Similarly, in 1971, more than 1 crore Bangladeshi refugees, came to India and even today this problem is still continued. Apart from this, continuous arrival of Nepalis, is also still continued. More than 5 lakhs Tamil refugees had come to India due to Sri Lankan Tamil problem. All these are responsible for population explosion.</li>
<li>
<h4>Other Causes</h4>
<p>Apart from the above, following are other causes of population explosion<br />
1- Social compulsion of Marriage<br />
2- Lack of means of entertainment<br />
3- Bhagyawati (fateful) view<br />
4- Ambition of big family<br />
5- Betterment in economic position<br />
6- Joint family system, etc.</li>

<h5>Is India over-populated? A critical examination of the present population policy.</h5>
<h3>POPULATION EXPLOSION</h3>
<div id="attachment_130" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-130" class="size-medium wp-image-130" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/over_population-300x181.jpg" alt="Population Explosion" width="300" height="181" /><p id="caption-attachment-130" class="wp-caption-text">Hindu devotees try to board a crowded passenger train to take part in the &#8220;Guru Purnima&#8221; festival in Goverdhan town near the northern Indian city of Mathura July 5, 2009.

<p>The fastest rise in the population of India was during the period of 1951 to 1981, in which the population was from 36 crores in 1951 was reached around to 70 crores in 1981. During this period of 30 years, population increased around 34 crores, which is the fastest rise in the history of population statistics.

<span id="more-128"></span></p>
<h3>Population Explosion And Economic Development</h3>
<p>Ordinarily, with an increase in population, production also increases and the number of those people also increases, among whom the total increase in production is distributed. Thus, the ultimate effect of increase in population on the level of production per head, would be indifferent or negative. This would depend on the form of increase in population and its directions. If the increase is in the number of dependents, then in place of production, consumers would increase and ultimately the effect on per head production would be adverse. On the contrary, in case of favorable age constitution of the population, its effect on the economic development would be better.</p>
<h3>EFFECTS OF THE INCREASING POPULATION IN INDIA ON ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH</h3>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has adversely affected the economic development and economy, which is clear from the following facts</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>Due to the increasing population, the rate of development has been slow. Whereas; the growth rate of Japan during the previous 10 years has been 15%, while the average growth rate of India has been 4% only.</li>
<li>
<h4>Widespread Poverty</h4>
<p>Due to heavy population the benefit of economic development is almost nil in the country. Though during the last 30 years there has been an increase of 15% in the national income, still the per ca-pita income has increased ‘50% only. About 50% of the population of the country is below the poverty line. Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/poverty-problem-india/">Problem of Poverty in India</a></li>
<li>
<h4>High Prices</h4>
<p>Due to higher population we find scarcity everywhere and due to scarcity, the prices are heading towards an increase. The country has scarcity of food-grains, scarcity of employment, scarcity of essentials, scarcity of houses, scarcity of oil etc..</li>
<li>
<h4>Excess Burden on the Economy</h4>
<p>The 1.5 crore of increase in the population each year is increasing the burden on the Indian economy.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problems in Industrialization</h4>
<p>Our country has poverty and unemployment only due to higher population. The level of savings and investments is lower and mechanization is discouraged due to excess human resources. The small and cottage industries are primary. Due to all these reasons rapid industrialization has not become possible. The slow pace of capital formation is also a hurdle in <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrialization in India.</a></li>
<li>
<h4>Expenditure on Population Control</h4>
<p>The explosive increase in population in India has forced expenditure of crores of rupees on population control under planned development. These resources would otherwise have been used in the economic development of the country and the standard of living would have improved.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Unemployment</h4>
<p>The means of employment do not increase at the same rate as the increase in population, as a result the existing <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">problem of unemployment</a> becomes more dreadful. This is the reason for continuous increase in unemployment in India. At the beginning of the first plan, the numbers of unemployed were 35 millions which increased to 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Food-gains</h4>
<p>Due to the rapid increase in population, to fulfill the requirements of the population since several years, millions of tons of food-grains has to be imported. This has adversely affected the foreign trade.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of the Increasing Number of Dependents</h4>
<p>Rapid increase in population increases the burden of number of dependents. According to the 1961 census 47.3% of the population was dependent which increased today to 71.1%.</li>
<li>
<h4>Problem of Capital Formation</h4>
<p>The increase in income due to the economic development is expended in catering to the needs of the increased population, as a result capital formation cannot be increased and investment rate remains lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Hinders the Growth of Agriculture and Industry</h4>
<p>Increasing population hinders the quick development of agriculture.<br />
It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdivision of land reduces the area of land per person</li>
<li>The burden of population on agriculture increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the increasing population hinders the growth of industry also. Rapid increase in population decreases the savings and investment rates. During lack of capital, the pace of industrial development is slow.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase In the Burden of Public Utility Services</h4>
<p>For the rapid increase in population, the government has to incur more on housing, education, health, welfare, law and order and security. Thus, funds for development work fall short.</li>
