<div id="attachment_73" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73" class="size-medium wp-image-73" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/norman_borlaug-300x200.jpg" alt="Norman Borlaug" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-73" class="wp-caption-text">American agronomist, Dr Norman Borlaug</p></div>
<p>The Green Revolution was started in India by then Prime Minister Late Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, who gave the slogan of <strong>“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”</strong>, according to which, to make the country powerful from security point of, view, is the responsibility of the soldiers, while making it self sufficient in the field of food grains, is the responsibility of the farmers.<br />

<h3>Criticism, Shortcomings And Failure Of Green Revolution In India</h3>
<p>Some critics are of the view that Green revolution has not been very successful in India. It has benefited only some limited farmers. Due to the preference given to some areas, regional inequalities have arisen. Use of excessive fertilizers has made the land useless. It has been criticized on the basis of the following facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Unemployment</h4>
<p>In the rural areas due to extensive agricultural programs, mechanization has been rapid, which has increased unemployment. It is inappropriate for countries like India, where unemployment is already a problem. In this way <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment is increasing in rural areas</a>.</li>
<li>
<h4>More Dependence on Fertilizers</h4>
<p>In this agricultural policy, use of fertilizers is given more importance than irrigation, which is not appropriate because in the absence of irrigation, fertilizers have no use. Due to this reason, the fertility of land has decreased in some areas.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economic Inequalities</h4>
<p>The benefit of Green revolution has been received mainly by the prosper farmers. The poor farmers have not benefited from this policy. It has enhanced the economic inequalities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regional Inequalities</h4>
<p>Under the Green Revolution movement, the implementation of agricultural resources was aimed only in naturally favorable areas, due to which some areas developed and some places were not given any attention. This increased regional difficulties. The prosper areas became more prosper and the backward became more backward.</li>
<li>
<h4>Benefited only a Few Crops</h4>
<p>Green revolution has been successful only on a few crops, specially wheat, rice, maize, jwar and baajra. No work has been done for other crops. Specially relating to crops like cotton or sugarcane etc..</li>
<li>
<h4>Difficulty in Storage</h4>
<p>The progress of agriculture has given rise to an additional problem of storage. At present, the storage capacity of our country is 2.5 crore tons, which is not sufficient with regard to production.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Experience</h4>
<p>Due to unavailability of scientifically developed seeds in India, farmers have been lacking experience experience about them. What effect these modem resources would have on Indian conditions, is not known certainly. Working without experience is like walking without knowing the path, where possibility of going in the wrong direction is more.</li>
<li>
<h4>Difficulties in the Use of Modern Techniques</h4>
<p>Most of the Indian farmers have small lands, hence they have problems in using the modern equipment designed for big lands. In this way, these farmers have remained in acquitted from the benefits of green revolution.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Suggestions For Success of Green Revolution</h3>
<div id="attachment_75" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" class="size-medium wp-image-75" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/green-revolution-300x225.jpg" alt="Green Revolution" width="300" height="225" /><p id="caption-attachment-75" class="wp-caption-text">Green Revolution</p></div>
<ol>
<li>The small farmers should be provided credit facilities at lower interest rates than the big farmers.</li>
<li>The modern techniques should be made profitable for small farmers.</li>
<li>The land development programs should be made effective and activated on a large scale.</li>
<li>The marketing system of agriculture should be improved.</li>
<li>To solve the problem of unemployment due to increased use of instruments and machines the small and cottage industries should be rapidly developed.</li>
<li>The labor intensive techniques should be given preference.</li>
<li>Improved variety of seeds should be developed.</li>
<li>Crop insurance should be started on a large scale for farmers.</li>
<li>The education, research and expansion services should be developed in villages</li>
<li>Irrigation facilities should be expanded.</li>
<li>Landless laborers and farmers should be united.</li>
<li>Programs for plant protection should be expanded.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An Introduction To Green Revolution In India</h2>

<li>
<h4>Self Dependence</h4>
<p>The use of developed and modern agricultural implements is given more importance under Green revolution, which has made sufficient increase in the agricultural produce of the country. In 1970-71, the food-grains production was 8 crore tons which increased to about 95 crore tons today. The credit of huge increase in food-grains production in such less time goes to Green revolution. The production of commercial crops like cotton, jute, oil-seeds etc. has also increased as expected.</li>
<li>
<h4>Commercialization of Agriculture</h4>
<p>Till now, agriculture was supposed to be a means of livelihood in the country. Due to the Green revolution, productivity per hectare has increased.Agriculture no longer remains a means of livelihood but now farming is done also for profit making. In this way, the process of its development has increased naturally.</li>
<li>
<h4>Use of Fertilizers</h4>
<p>Now each such farmer of the village has started using chemical fertilizers, who feared its use.</li>
<li>
<h4>Irrigation Facilities in Wider Areas</h4>
<p>Due to expansion of small irrigation plans under the Green revolution, the total irrigated area has increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Change in Attitudes</h4>
<p>The old farmers always remained dependent on fate.but the results of Green revolution have changed the attitude of farmers. Now he has started believing in Karma than fate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Reduction in Imports and Export Promotion</h4>
<p>By Green revolution, on one hand food-grains etc. are now produced in the country, by which on one hand exports have increased and on the other hand imports have reduced. This has encouraged import substitution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Use of Insecticides</h4>
<p>After the Green revolution, there has been sufficient increase in the use of insecticides.</li>
<li>
<h4>Multiple Crop Program</h4>
<p>The aim of multiple crop program in the Green revolution was to produce more than one crop during,the year and increase production. This plan was first implemented in 1967-68. For this, at present 80 schemes has been running, in which experiments and exhibitions of growing two or three crops are done.</li>
<li>
<h4>Rural Electrification</h4>
<p>Under the Green revolution, the rural electrification Program has been implemented for raising the standard of rural life and providing electricity for agricultural purposes. At the time of implementation of the first plan, electricity was available only in 3000 villages, but now in almost 70% of the villages of the entire country have electricity. To provide funds for supply of electricity in the villages, the Rural Electrification Corporation are also established.</p>
