								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Defects/Problems Of Indian Agricultural Marketing</h3>
<p>Even though India is an agricultural country, still its <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/05/agricultural-marketing-problems/">agricultural marketing has been defective</a>. The Indian farmers are unable to get reasonable price for the products even after their hard work and are fully exploited by the middlemen.<span id="more-255"></span></p>
<h2>SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETING</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of Mediators</h4>
<p>The elimination of mediators is necessary from agricultural marketing, because unless the farmer is allowed the facility of direct sales to the customer, he cannot receive a fair price for it. Thus, with the elimination of mediators, ‘consumer grain centers’ should be established where the farmer sells his produce.</li>
<li>
<h4>Use of Standard Weight</h4>
<p>For improving agricultural marketing standard weights are specifically required, these should be manufactured and organised by the government. If, any defect in weights is reported, strict punishment system should be started so that, there should be no fraud in marketing. This would not only improve the marketing system but the fraudulent tendencies of the traders would also be restricted.</li>
<li>
<h4>Loan Facilities</h4>
<p>In villages loans for the farmers are arranged by well-up people, moneylenders etc., who also make a deal of their produce and exploit them on its basis. If, the government establishes banks, cooperative societies or other financial organisations then this problem can be solved. The farmers in the villages should also be encouraged to spend economically and save money so that at the time of need they get money from their savings. By this, the farmers would not sell their produce in a hurry and get full profits out of it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Means of Transport</h4>
<p>The backbone of agricultural marketing is means of transport. Thus, such roads should be constructed in rural areas which remain capable of transportation during all seasons. The tire made bullock carts, diesel or patrol trucks or tractors should be available in rural areas. Similarly, rail and water transport development is also necessary, keeping in view the marketing of agricultural produce, so that the grains and other perishable products can be quickly sent to the market.</li>
<li>
<h4>Publicity of Market Policies</h4>
<p>Sufficient arrangements should be made for the transmission of the authorized prices of agricultural produce and quantity of production etc. so that the facts relating to agricultural marketing can be put before the concerned parties.</li>
<li>
<h4>Training Facilities</h4>
<p>For the improvement of agricultural marketing, it is necessary that arrangements are made for the appropriate training of the employees related to marketing administration. Training with regard to the system of controlled markets etc., is very important for the improvement of agricultural marketing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regulation of ‘Mandis’</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-256 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/integrated-scheme-for-agricultural-marketing-300x201.jpg" alt="Agricultural MArketing" width="300" height="201" /><br />
To provide a fair price to the farmers for their produce in the mandis, ‘organised mandis’ should be established by the government, appropriate arrangements should be made in these mandi-markets for weighting, storage, transport etc. and the farmers should also be given regularly powers in it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Market Survey</h4>
<p>The Indian government should establish Marketing and Inspection Directorate for market survey, which collect useful data relating to production, consumption, export, demand price level, standardization, distribution system etc. and publishes them from time to time.</li>
<li>
<h4>Stores Management</h4>
<p>The Indian government has established The All India Storage Corporation realizing the importance of storage. The object of this corporation is to establish stores in villages, cooperative societies are instructed to organize the stores system. For this they are provided additional, technical and financial assistance.</li>
<li>
<h4>Grading and Standardization of Products</h4>
<p>Though the Agricultural Production Act was passed in 1937 for standardization etc. of agricultural products, still no recognizable progress has been made in this direction. For making an effective system of expansion of the activity of gradation and quality control, laboratories should be established. A central laboratory was established in Nagpur and provisional laboratories were established in Madras, Kanpur, Rajkot, Amritsar, Calcutta and Mumbai but these should be situated in small villages and not in big towns.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Marketing</h2>
<p><em>Agricultural marketing refers to all those processes which relate to taking the agricultural product from the farmers to the consumers. Agricultural marketing includes gathering the agricultural produce, their standardization and grading, their storage, sending them to the market through various middlemen, selling in the market and arranging the required finance etc.</em></p>
<h3>Defects/Problems Of Indian Agricultural Marketing</h3>
<p>Even though India is an agricultural country, still its agricultural marketing has been defective. The Indian farmers are unable to get reasonable price for the products even after their hard work and are fully exploited by the middlemen.<span id="more-251"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Too Many Intermediates</h4>
<div id="attachment_252" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252" class="size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fruit_vegetable_market-300x200.jpg" alt="Agricultural Marketing" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-252" class="wp-caption-text">Fruit &amp; Vegetables Market</p></div>
<p>The one main defect of the Indian Agricultural marketing is the presence of too many middlemen and exploitation of farmers by them. On one hand these middlemen exploit the farmers by purchasing the produce at lower prices and on the other hand they exploit the customers by demanding higher prices from them. The only aim of a number of commission agents, brokers etc. is to derive a higher income from the middle processes. These middlemen take undue advantage of the poor former on the basis of their financial resources.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Weights and Scales</h4>
<p>One of the biggest defects of agricultural marketing arises due to weights and scales. Usually, in rural areas bricks, etc. are used as weights and in urban markets also defective weights are found. Thus, the grain of the farmer is weighed by a heavier weight for their own gain. Most of the traders keep separate weights for purchase and sale of grain.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Lack of Unity among Farmers</h4>
<p>The Indian farmers are illiterate who are easier be fooled by the money lenders, traders, middlemen, due to their simple nature. Similarly, lack of unity among farmers also causes their exploitation because Indian farmers are spread in distant areas in rural places. They are unable to meet with each other and resolve their problems, as a result they do not get a fair price for their produce.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Financial Resources</h4>
<p>In the rural areas there is lack of financial resources, due to which even their emergency requirements are not fulfilled. In such conditions the farmers sell their produce before its ripening. Similarly, some financial facilities, like, installments on loans for pumping-set, tractor, thrasher etc. have to be paid on monthly or quarterly basis due to which they have to sell the product as soon as possible. Thus, as the lack of financial assistance, is a problem for the farmers; so does the receipt of loan also puts them in problem.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Organised Marketing System</h4>
<p>The agricultural marketing is also very defective in India because here organised marketing is not in vogue, like, cooperative societies, government marketing activities, regular markets etc. As a result, the farmer remains entangled In exploitation. Thus, lack of organised marketing system is harmful for the farmers. That is -why; the farmer sells his product personally to different people. The middle take full advantage of the unorganized farmers.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Transport Facilities</h4>
<p>The roads from Villages to cities are usually unmade which are not capable of transport during the rainy season. The bullock carts can take the product only up to a limited area. During lack of transport facilities the farmer is unable to take his produce to the appropriate market and is unable to receive a fair price for his product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Store Houses</h4>
<p>An important deficiency of Indian agricultural marketing is lack of store houses. Due to lack of this facility the farmer is unable to keep his product safely until it can fetch a fair price, and he is forced to sell his product at a low price. The insufficient and unscientific facilities of shortage which are available, waste large quantities of grains. Approximately 20% to 30% grains are lost due to rats, insects etc. and the farmers have to bear crores of loss due to lack of these facilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Standardization</h4>
<p>The lack of standardization and grading is clearly visible in the Indian Agricultural marketing, due to which fixing a deal in relation to these products becomes difficult. Due to lack of proper standardization and grading the customers have problem in purchasing the product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Awareness of the Market</h4>
<p>The Indian farmer has no knowledge about marketing. He believes on information acquired from the businessmen and money lenders of the village. Mostly, the Indian farmers are illiterate so they cannot read the newspaper. Thus, they do not have sufficient knowledge about the market. Now, government transmits the rates of the market on the ratio, which has definitely benefited them.</li>
<li>
<h4>Corrupt Policies of the ‘Mandis’</h4>
<p>If we observe the condition of the mandis, this fact is no more hidden that the middlemen and the traders jointly make fool the simple farmers. The Indian Organizing Society has clarified the following facts relating to the corrupt policies of the mandis</p>
<ul>
<li>The inappropriate marketing system is so deep laden in India that about 5% of the amount is deducted from the farmer’s produce in the name of donations, ‘dharmada’, ‘chanda’ etc.</li>
<li>The farmers are paid low price, as they lack appropriate knowledge about market prices, their fluctuations, government policies etc. Thus, by keeping the rates secret, the farmers are cheated.</li>
<li>Before the sale, large amounts of grains are taken from the farmers as samples. By declaring the product to be of sub standard quality minimum prices are paid for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
