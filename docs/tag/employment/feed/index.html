								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Labor</h2>
<p>Agricultural labor is that person who works on another land, does not participate in farm management and its maintenance, and receives money or a portion of the harvest in consideration for his service. He neither has any rights regarding the land, nor does he have to bear any risk regarding the farm. Briefly by agricultural labor we mean’ such laborers who <em><strong>“earn their livelihood by working on agricultural farms.”</strong></em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Second Agricultural Labor Investigation society</p>
<blockquote><p>Agricultural labor refers to that person who receives more than half of the income from agriculture. The agricultural labor family refers to that family, whose more than half of the income from agriculture.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-233"></span></p>
<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<div id="attachment_234" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" class="size-medium wp-image-234" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agri_labor-300x220.jpg" alt="Agricultural Labor" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Labor</p></div>
<p>Describing the conditions of Indian agricultural labor P.T.Mayya writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Indian laborer spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excess Working Hours</h4>
<p>The working hours of these laborer are not only irregular but also excessive. They have to work since morning to late night. His working hours change with harvest, season and work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Seasonal Employment</h4>
<p>The agricultural labor does not get work for the whole year. According to the Second Agricultural Labor Investigation Society, a Seasonal labor gets an average of 197 days of work in a year. Similarly, child labor gets 204 days and women get 141 days of employment. Thus, their average annual income is very lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Low Wages</h4>
<p>The wage level of agricultural labors very low as compared to that of industrial labor. It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in landless laborers</li>
<li>lack of non-agricultural areas of work in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Agricultural Slavery</h4>
<p>Majority of agricultural laborers are landless and of backward classes. Due to their lower social status they are treated as animals. Big land owners make them work as slaves. They are used as laborers and in return given minimum wages.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indebtedness</h4>
<p>Due to lower income, the indebtedness of agricultural farmers is increasing. They hesitate in negotiating their wages with the land owners in the fear that their services would be terminated. The laborers remain indebted even after working with the land owners for their whole life.</li>
<li>
<h4>Not United</h4>
<p>Since the agricultural laborers are spread in millions of village all over the country they lack unity. Thus, they are unable to negotiate their wages etc. with the land owners by uniting themselves.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Child and Women Laborers</h4>
<p>Due to lower income the children and women of agricultural laborers are also forced to work for their livelihood. The child and women laborers are made to work more for livelihood. Thus, exploitation of child labor and woman labor is a major problem in the field of agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lower Social Status</h4>
<p>Most of the agricultural laborers are of backward classes who have been exploited since centuries. Due to this reason also their social status is lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Other Jobs</h4>
<p>There is shortage of other jobs in villages. Thus, if the crop is destroyed by floods, famines etc., it becomes difficult for the agricultural labor to survive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Housing Problem</h4>
<p>The landless laborers have no private house. They live in cottages, made on the useless land of the landowners with their permission and in its return they have to work without payment, for the landowners. When a number of people live under the same root, the physical, social, moral and religious problem arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment due to mechanization</h4>
<p>At the present times, due to increase in the use of machines, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment</a> rate among the illiterate agricultural farmers is increasing, which is a serious problem for them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Meaning of Poverty</h3>
<p>Poverty refers to that social condition in which a part of the society is unable to fulfill its basic requirements. When a big portion of the population is deprived of the minimum living standard and survives only on the survival level, then it is said that poverty is widely spread in the population.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Poverty in India</h2>
<p>India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70 years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form.<br />
<span id="more-171"></span></p>
<h3>CAUSES OF POVERTY IN INDIA</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>The growth rate of the Indian economy is very low. During the 55 years of the planning period the average growth rate has been 3.5% which has deepened the roots of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mumbai-street-kids.jpg" alt="Unemployment In India" width="250" height="263" /><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Unemployment In India</p></div>
<p>The increasing rate of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment in the country</a> has spread more problem. Due to increasing unemployment, poverty has taken a more serious form. For example, the number of unemployed in the country at the beginning of the first plan was 35 million, which is about 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Political Causes</h4>
<p>The long bondage of the country has slowed the pace of the economy. The foreign invaders took no interest in the development of basic industries. The Zami-dari system started in the country which exploited the farmers completely. Their agricultural policies gave birth to landless farmers and their exploitation. Poverty also increased their exploitation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditional Production Techniques</h4>
<p>In the fields of agriculture and manufacture, the production techniques are traditional which have lowered the production level due to which poverty has increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p>In India inflation has taken an alarming shape. Due to this, people are unable to fulfill the basic requirements of their families. Today 50% of the population of our country is covered under the poor class.</li>
<li>
<h4>Dependency on Agriculture</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India depends on agriculture for their living. Each family has a small amount of land. Everyone live together and live with difficulty on a small land and due to the dependency only on agriculture, the person remains poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alcoholism</h4>
<p>In India, poverty has also increased due to alcoholism. Each day, in India million of people are destroying their money and health due to the habits of alcoholism. Thus, alcoholism is one of the reasons of the increasing this problem in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Belief in Fate</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India give importance to conservative attitude and analyse each aspect on the basis of fate. People become inactive on the thought that it is their fate that is making things happen and live lifelong in the lap of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Adverse Environment and Climate</h4>
<p>On the peaks of Himalayas there is always a snowfall, Rajasthan is also under the same climate in another form. Due to the desert, farming etc. is not possible there and poverty has increased. Thus, the adversity of the environment and the climate has a deep impact on growth of the nation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The places where the land is infertile, there is absence of resources for the production. Coal or iron, minerals etc. are also not available there, people of that place are poor. Due to geographical reasons there are several places in India whose 100% of the population is poor. Like, the land of the hilly areas is not at all fit for agriculture. Moreover, due to lack of resources for agriculture also people are poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Harm by Insects</h4>
<p>The termites attack, the south Indian drops even today and destroy the crops. Moreover, many kinds of insects and rats destroy the wheat, maize, paddy etc., crops. The grains stored by the traders are also destroyed by these insects and rats. On an estimate, about 15 to, 20% of the crops are destroyed by them. Thus, this is also one of the reasons of Indian poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Social Evils</h4>
<p>There are several social evils WI India, like dowry, child marriage, Parda system, etc. which have several bad effects and help in raising poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Industries</h4>
<div id="attachment_172" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172" class="size-medium wp-image-172" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paper-bag-maker-300x200.jpg" alt="Poverty In India" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-172" class="wp-caption-text">Paper bag maker and seller, Varanasi India</p></div>
<p>The industry could not develop properly in India. Due to the lack of industries, poverty can be seen on each side in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Caste System</h4>
<p>Due to caste system people have to carry on their traditional work, even if, they are unprofitable. That is why, the rich people of olden times did not accept small or low grade jobs and instead preferred to die without food, as a result poverty increased in our country.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditions</h4>
<p>Everything is related with religion in India. For the sake of their own customs and traditions, the illiterate people spend thousands of rupees, and take loans for their traditions and stay strangulated in poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unbalanced Growth of Industries</h4>
<p>The opportunity of industrial development came after independence but due to the policies of the British rule the cottage industries could not get protection. This gave rise to unemployment and poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Natural Calamities</h4>
<p>Indian agriculture is dependent on rains, even today. Sometimes, due to less rainfall drought occurs and sometimes due to heavy rainfall crones of rupees of crop is destroyed. These natural calamities have also been responsible for poverty in India.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Suggestions For Removing Unemployment In India</h2>
<p>This article focus on &#8220;<em>Suggestions For Removing Unemployment In India</em>&#8220;, for reasons of Unemployment In India please refer <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">here</a>.<br />
<span id="more-121"></span></p>
<h3>Possible Solutions To Unemployment In India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Control on Population Growth</h4>
<div id="attachment_151" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151" class="size-medium wp-image-151" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unemployment-300x199.jpg" alt="Unemployment in India" width="300" height="199" /><p id="caption-attachment-151" class="wp-caption-text">It is disturbing as well as distressing to find that the standard of living of man is still below the desired level and unemployment is on the increase.</p></div>
<p>To control unemployment appropriate controls on population growth should be made, otherwise on the basis of the present growth rate, India’s population would become more than 125 crores by the year 2015.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Non-agricultural Subsidiary Industries</h4>
<p>In India agriculture witnesses seasonal unemployment. Thus, in villages the agriculture related industries must be developed so that the farmer is able to earn something in free time. For this, the subsidiary activities of animal husbandry, poultry farming, gardening, milk business etc. can be developed.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Small Industries</h4>
<p>Small and cottage industries must be established, so that people get employment at low capital investment. For this, such small scale industries must be developed which are labor intensive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Full Capacity Utilization</h4>
<p>Many industries in India are working at less than their full capacity. Such industries must be encouraged to utilize their full capacity, so that employment opportunities may be increased in such industries.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The government should search for such natural resources by which new industries may be established. It is a known fact that natural resources are in abundance in India, that is why, it was named as the<em> “Golden bird”</em>.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Investment</h4>
<p>To increase the. employment opportunities, household savings must be encouraged, so that more capital formation may be done and investment increases. This would assist in the establishment of new industries and employment opportunities would increase.</li>
<li>
<h4>Demand and Supply of Labor</h4>
<p>The demand and supply of labor should be coordinated in various production areas. For this, the future demand and supply of labor should be estimated and arrangements for their training etc. be made accordingly, so that the laborers in excess of the demand may find employment, elsewhere.</li>
<li>
<h4>Establishment of Power Houses in Villages</h4>
<p>About 80% of the population of the country lives in villages. To remove unemployment among the 80% population the “Bhagwati Committee”gave suggestions for the establishment of power houses in villages so that small industries may develop and no work stop in villages at night due to darkness.</li>
<li>
<h4>Suggestions of the Labor Commission</h4>
<p>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Labor Commission</span></em> gave the following suggestions for the solution of the problem of unemployment and underemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>Predetermination of a national policy for employment</li>
<li>Formation of All India Manpower Services</li>
<li>Change in the education policy</li>
<li>Rapid industrial development</li>
<li>Survey the human resources of the country</li>
<li>Strengthen the job counselling services</li>
<li>Maintain at least one office at each community Development Division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Other Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the construction of roads</li>
<li>Provide facilities to construct rural houses</li>
<li>Expansion of small irrigation facilities</li>
<li>Agricultural service centers be established so that the technical people get employment also in villages.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Keynesian Theory was given by Keynes when in his volume “<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</span></em>” had not only criticized the <strong>Classical Theory of Employment</strong>, but had also analyzed those factors that affect the employment and production level of an economy. Most of the modern economists agree with the concept of Keynes. The Keynesian Theory of Employment is a produce of the world-wide depression of 1931-36. Due to this depression, unemployment spread in all independent capitalist economies. Keynes analyzed that situation of unemployment and tried to find the reason and solution to that problem.<span id="more-54"></span><br />
During that time, the theories of British economist John Maynard Keynes—of deficit-based, government stimulus spending and strong regulation of markets—dominated economic policy and thought.</p>
<h2>Explanation of the Theory of Employment</h2>
<p><em>“Classical theory of Employment”</em>, but had also analyzed those factors that affect the employment and production level of an economy. Most of the modern economists agree with the concept of Keynes. The Keynesian Theory of Employment is a produce of the world-wide depression of 1931-36. Due to this depression, unemployment spread in all independent capitalist economies. Keynes analyzed that situation of unemployment and tried to find the reason and solution to that problem.</p>
<p>According to this theory, since the demand for goods and services is not so much that the total actual resources may be utilized, unemployment arises. In the words of Keynes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The deficiency in effective demand, stops the increase in employment to reach the full employment level.</p></blockquote>
<p>On an increase in the effective demand of the consumers, the resources are utilized in large quantities, and the level of employment rises. When people start demanding another product in place of a product temporarily, unemployment would increase due to fall in total demand, it shall be of irregular nature. Actually, a permanent fall in demand occurs, when instead of making expenditure on consumer goods, people try to save most part of their incomes. A deficiency in demand for goods and services in one sector of the society in not compensated by an increase in demand for goods and services in another sector, and total demand declines. Thus, if the desire to save from their particular income is more than the desire for substitution expenditure have become a reverse relationship, demand and employment increases i.e., when the desire to save, among people is lesser than the substitution expenditure in the society, demand and employment increases.</p>
<p>In Keynes view, the level of employment of any country depends on its effective demand. Effective demand depends on total supply of production and the total demand. The total supply of a production depends on total investment and total consumption. The amount of consumption is affected by the tendency for consumption, and the size of national income. As the income of a person increases, his tendency to consume comparatively reduces. On the other hand, it depends on the amount of investment, rate of interest, and mostly on the marginal efficiency of capital. In the money market, the demand for capital shall be more even during the period of high rates of interest, if in view of the investors, capital is more efficient. The marginal efficiency of capital depends on the substitution cost and the anticipated profits.</p>
<h2>Reasons of Spreading of Unemployment</h2>
<p>According to Keynes, the three main reasons of spreading of unemployment are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of effective demand</li>
<li>Deficiency of outlay on consumption</li>
<li>Deficiency of investment</li>
</ol>
