								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Labor</h2>
<p>Agricultural labor is that person who works on another land, does not participate in farm management and its maintenance, and receives money or a portion of the harvest in consideration for his service. He neither has any rights regarding the land, nor does he have to bear any risk regarding the farm. Briefly by agricultural labor we mean’ such laborers who <em><strong>“earn their livelihood by working on agricultural farms.”</strong></em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Second Agricultural Labor Investigation society</p>
<blockquote><p>Agricultural labor refers to that person who receives more than half of the income from agriculture. The agricultural labor family refers to that family, whose more than half of the income from agriculture.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-233"></span></p>
<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<div id="attachment_234" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" class="size-medium wp-image-234" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agri_labor-300x220.jpg" alt="Agricultural Labor" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Labor</p></div>
<p>Describing the conditions of Indian agricultural labor P.T.Mayya writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Indian laborer spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excess Working Hours</h4>
<p>The working hours of these laborer are not only irregular but also excessive. They have to work since morning to late night. His working hours change with harvest, season and work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Seasonal Employment</h4>
<p>The agricultural labor does not get work for the whole year. According to the Second Agricultural Labor Investigation Society, a Seasonal labor gets an average of 197 days of work in a year. Similarly, child labor gets 204 days and women get 141 days of employment. Thus, their average annual income is very lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Low Wages</h4>
<p>The wage level of agricultural labors very low as compared to that of industrial labor. It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in landless laborers</li>
<li>lack of non-agricultural areas of work in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Agricultural Slavery</h4>
<p>Majority of agricultural laborers are landless and of backward classes. Due to their lower social status they are treated as animals. Big land owners make them work as slaves. They are used as laborers and in return given minimum wages.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indebtedness</h4>
<p>Due to lower income, the indebtedness of agricultural farmers is increasing. They hesitate in negotiating their wages with the land owners in the fear that their services would be terminated. The laborers remain indebted even after working with the land owners for their whole life.</li>
<li>
<h4>Not United</h4>
<p>Since the agricultural laborers are spread in millions of village all over the country they lack unity. Thus, they are unable to negotiate their wages etc. with the land owners by uniting themselves.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Child and Women Laborers</h4>
<p>Due to lower income the children and women of agricultural laborers are also forced to work for their livelihood. The child and women laborers are made to work more for livelihood. Thus, exploitation of child labor and woman labor is a major problem in the field of agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lower Social Status</h4>
<p>Most of the agricultural laborers are of backward classes who have been exploited since centuries. Due to this reason also their social status is lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Other Jobs</h4>
<p>There is shortage of other jobs in villages. Thus, if the crop is destroyed by floods, famines etc., it becomes difficult for the agricultural labor to survive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Housing Problem</h4>
<p>The landless laborers have no private house. They live in cottages, made on the useless land of the landowners with their permission and in its return they have to work without payment, for the landowners. When a number of people live under the same root, the physical, social, moral and religious problem arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment due to mechanization</h4>
<p>At the present times, due to increase in the use of machines, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment</a> rate among the illiterate agricultural farmers is increasing, which is a serious problem for them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Problem of Poverty in India</h2>
<p>India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70 years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form. We have also discussed about various <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/poverty-problem-india/">Reasons Why India Is Still a Poor Country</a>.<br />
<span id="more-190"></span></p>
<h2>Efforts Of Government To Eradicate Poverty In India</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Employment Opportunities</h4>
<p>For eliminating poverty, the government has made wide efforts to provide employment opportunities. At present the policy of ‘Grain for Work’ has been applied, which is giving employment opportunities to million of villagers.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Agriculture</h4>
<div id="attachment_193" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-193" class="size-medium wp-image-193" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NP_Himachal_Pradesh_68_6348260166-300x199.jpg" alt="Agricultural Development should Eradicate Poverty" width="300" height="199" /><p id="caption-attachment-193" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Development should Eradicate Poverty</p></div>
<p>The government has done commendable work in relating to the availability of irrigation, research, modern techniques, standard quality seeds and fertilizers for the development of agriculture. For irrigation facilities special river-valley projects are made.</li>
<li>
<h4>Fair Market Price and Transportation</h4>
<p>The farmers get a fair price for their produce , many efforts have been made in this direction. The government has established appropriate market organisations and sources of transportation are developed for this purpose.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encouraging Industrial Development</h4>
<p>The government paid attention to <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrial development</a>. This is supposed to give much encouragement to economic development. Along with this, important steps are being taken for the development of cottage industries. Through this, about 6 crore people have been employed.</li>
<li>
<h4>Family Planning</h4>
<p>The government has encouraged programs for family planning to bring down the birth rate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Chak-bandi</h4>
<p>The government has developed the “chakbandi” system to increase production. Under this several small fields are joined to make a big field. Moreover, cooperative farming is also being developed.</li>
<li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Meaning of Poverty</h3>
<p>Poverty refers to that social condition in which a part of the society is unable to fulfill its basic requirements. When a big portion of the population is deprived of the minimum living standard and survives only on the survival level, then it is said that poverty is widely spread in the population.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Poverty in India</h2>
<p>India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70 years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form.<br />
<span id="more-171"></span></p>
<h3>CAUSES OF POVERTY IN INDIA</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Lower Growth Rate</h4>
<p>The growth rate of the Indian economy is very low. During the 55 years of the planning period the average growth rate has been 3.5% which has deepened the roots of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mumbai-street-kids.jpg" alt="Unemployment In India" width="250" height="263" /><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Unemployment In India</p></div>
<p>The increasing rate of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment in the country</a> has spread more problem. Due to increasing unemployment, poverty has taken a more serious form. For example, the number of unemployed in the country at the beginning of the first plan was 35 million, which is about 26 crores in 2010.</li>
<li>
<h4>Political Causes</h4>
<p>The long bondage of the country has slowed the pace of the economy. The foreign invaders took no interest in the development of basic industries. The Zami-dari system started in the country which exploited the farmers completely. Their agricultural policies gave birth to landless farmers and their exploitation. Poverty also increased their exploitation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditional Production Techniques</h4>
<p>In the fields of agriculture and manufacture, the production techniques are traditional which have lowered the production level due to which poverty has increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Inflation</h4>
<p>In India inflation has taken an alarming shape. Due to this, people are unable to fulfill the basic requirements of their families. Today 50% of the population of our country is covered under the poor class.</li>
<li>
<h4>Dependency on Agriculture</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India depends on agriculture for their living. Each family has a small amount of land. Everyone live together and live with difficulty on a small land and due to the dependency only on agriculture, the person remains poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alcoholism</h4>
<p>In India, poverty has also increased due to alcoholism. Each day, in India million of people are destroying their money and health due to the habits of alcoholism. Thus, alcoholism is one of the reasons of the increasing this problem in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Belief in Fate</h4>
<p>Most of the population in India give importance to conservative attitude and analyse each aspect on the basis of fate. People become inactive on the thought that it is their fate that is making things happen and live lifelong in the lap of poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Adverse Environment and Climate</h4>
<p>On the peaks of Himalayas there is always a snowfall, Rajasthan is also under the same climate in another form. Due to the desert, farming etc. is not possible there and poverty has increased. Thus, the adversity of the environment and the climate has a deep impact on growth of the nation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The places where the land is infertile, there is absence of resources for the production. Coal or iron, minerals etc. are also not available there, people of that place are poor. Due to geographical reasons there are several places in India whose 100% of the population is poor. Like, the land of the hilly areas is not at all fit for agriculture. Moreover, due to lack of resources for agriculture also people are poor.</li>
<li>
<h4>Harm by Insects</h4>
<p>The termites attack, the south Indian drops even today and destroy the crops. Moreover, many kinds of insects and rats destroy the wheat, maize, paddy etc., crops. The grains stored by the traders are also destroyed by these insects and rats. On an estimate, about 15 to, 20% of the crops are destroyed by them. Thus, this is also one of the reasons of Indian poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Social Evils</h4>
<p>There are several social evils WI India, like dowry, child marriage, Parda system, etc. which have several bad effects and help in raising poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Industries</h4>
<div id="attachment_172" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172" class="size-medium wp-image-172" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paper-bag-maker-300x200.jpg" alt="Poverty In India" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-172" class="wp-caption-text">Paper bag maker and seller, Varanasi India</p></div>
<p>The industry could not develop properly in India. Due to the lack of industries, poverty can be seen on each side in India.</li>
<li>
<h4>Caste System</h4>
<p>Due to caste system people have to carry on their traditional work, even if, they are unprofitable. That is why, the rich people of olden times did not accept small or low grade jobs and instead preferred to die without food, as a result poverty increased in our country.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditions</h4>
<p>Everything is related with religion in India. For the sake of their own customs and traditions, the illiterate people spend thousands of rupees, and take loans for their traditions and stay strangulated in poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unbalanced Growth of Industries</h4>
<p>The opportunity of industrial development came after independence but due to the policies of the British rule the cottage industries could not get protection. This gave rise to unemployment and poverty.</li>
<li>
<h4>Natural Calamities</h4>
<p>Indian agriculture is dependent on rains, even today. Sometimes, due to less rainfall drought occurs and sometimes due to heavy rainfall crones of rupees of crop is destroyed. These natural calamities have also been responsible for poverty in India.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Suggestions For Removing Unemployment In India</h2>
<p>This article focus on &#8220;<em>Suggestions For Removing Unemployment In India</em>&#8220;, for reasons of Unemployment In India please refer <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">here</a>.<br />
<span id="more-121"></span></p>
<h3>Possible Solutions To Unemployment In India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Control on Population Growth</h4>
<div id="attachment_151" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151" class="size-medium wp-image-151" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unemployment-300x199.jpg" alt="Unemployment in India" width="300" height="199" /><p id="caption-attachment-151" class="wp-caption-text">It is disturbing as well as distressing to find that the standard of living of man is still below the desired level and unemployment is on the increase.</p></div>
<p>To control unemployment appropriate controls on population growth should be made, otherwise on the basis of the present growth rate, India’s population would become more than 125 crores by the year 2015.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Non-agricultural Subsidiary Industries</h4>
<p>In India agriculture witnesses seasonal unemployment. Thus, in villages the agriculture related industries must be developed so that the farmer is able to earn something in free time. For this, the subsidiary activities of animal husbandry, poultry farming, gardening, milk business etc. can be developed.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Small Industries</h4>
<p>Small and cottage industries must be established, so that people get employment at low capital investment. For this, such small scale industries must be developed which are labor intensive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Full Capacity Utilization</h4>
<p>Many industries in India are working at less than their full capacity. Such industries must be encouraged to utilize their full capacity, so that employment opportunities may be increased in such industries.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>The government should search for such natural resources by which new industries may be established. It is a known fact that natural resources are in abundance in India, that is why, it was named as the<em> “Golden bird”</em>.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Investment</h4>
<p>To increase the. employment opportunities, household savings must be encouraged, so that more capital formation may be done and investment increases. This would assist in the establishment of new industries and employment opportunities would increase.</li>
<li>
<h4>Demand and Supply of Labor</h4>
<p>The demand and supply of labor should be coordinated in various production areas. For this, the future demand and supply of labor should be estimated and arrangements for their training etc. be made accordingly, so that the laborers in excess of the demand may find employment, elsewhere.</li>
<li>
<h4>Establishment of Power Houses in Villages</h4>
<p>About 80% of the population of the country lives in villages. To remove unemployment among the 80% population the “Bhagwati Committee”gave suggestions for the establishment of power houses in villages so that small industries may develop and no work stop in villages at night due to darkness.</li>
<li>
<h4>Suggestions of the Labor Commission</h4>
<p>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Labor Commission</span></em> gave the following suggestions for the solution of the problem of unemployment and underemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>Predetermination of a national policy for employment</li>
<li>Formation of All India Manpower Services</li>
<li>Change in the education policy</li>
<li>Rapid industrial development</li>
<li>Survey the human resources of the country</li>
<li>Strengthen the job counselling services</li>
<li>Maintain at least one office at each community Development Division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Other Suggestions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start the construction of roads</li>
<li>Provide facilities to construct rural houses</li>
<li>Expansion of small irrigation facilities</li>
<li>Agricultural service centers be established so that the technical people get employment also in villages.</li>
</ul>
</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Unemployment In India</h2>
<p>In ordinary language, when a person does not find any work for his livelihood, he is called an unemployed and this problem is called the problem of unemployment. In other words, <span style="color: #216300;">if a person is willing to work and physically fit, and still does not get a job to earn his livelihood, such a condition is called unemployment.</span><br />

<h3>CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN INDIA</h3>
<p>No one reason can be held responsible for the widespread unemployment in India but the</p>
<p>following are the main causes of the problem in India</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Rapid Increase in Population</h4>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/mumbai-street-kids/" rel="attachment wp-att-118"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-image-118 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mumbai-street-kids-1-1.jpg" alt="Unemployment In India" width="250" height="263" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Unemployment In India</p></div>
<p>The present increase in population in India has created a imbalance in the demand and supply in the labor market. The increase in techniques, capital formation, natural resources etc. is not at the same rate as the rate of increase in population, due to which the additional people are not getting employment and unemployment is increasing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Uncertainty of Agriculture</h4>
<p>Even after the development of science, agriculture in India is dependent on the mercy of nature. Each year millions of laborers have to lose their jobs due to droughts and floods and other natural calamities due to which uncertainty in agriculture and unemployment arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improper Attitude</h4>
<p>One of the main reasons in this country is the want of a job by the educated people. They do not want to start their own production unit. Unemployment has also increased due to this improper attitude.</li>
<li>
<h4>Employment to Women</h4>
<p>During the decade of 1950 to 1960, very few women were working, but nowadays their number and percentage has increased. This has also increased unemployment among men.</li>
<li>
<h4>Wide Gap between Wages and Productivity</h4>
<p>Inflation is continuing in the country due to which prices keep increasing. Affected by this, the laborers demand more wages and incentives due to which the cost and price of commodities increases, but demand decreases. This follows reduced production and thus, increases in unemployment.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Planning</h4>
<p>Planning work has been going on in the country since independence, but this planning has been defective. A scholars opine that unemployment has also increased due to this reason.</li>
<li>
<h4>Irrational Mechanization</h4>
<p>The government has intentionally encouraged labor substitution activities, keeping in view development of heavy industries, due to which difficulties in the progress of employment opportunities have arisen. It is definite that labor substitution through irrational mechanization would naturally increase unemployment.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of an Extensive Employment Policy</h4>
<p>India has always lacked an extensive and short term employment policy. It is true that unless a solid employment oriented development policy is not evolved and implemented by a stable government of the country, the solution of the problem of unemployment is difficult. Apart from this, the hurdles in production activities, social environment, social evils, religious superstitions, political instability and industrial unrest are increasing the problem of unemployment.</li>
