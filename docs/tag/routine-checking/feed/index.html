								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have already discussed about purpose and objectives of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking/">Routine Checking</a>. In this article we will go through some merits and demerits of <em>Routine Checking</em>.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-196"></span></p>
<h2>Merits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Mathematical Accuracy</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" /> The mathematical mistakes of the books of accounts are known from this type of checking, it confirms that the accounts are mathematically accurate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is very easy. It can be done even by a person of ordinary abilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Basis of Final Checking</h4>
<p>It also helps in the checking of Trial Balance and Final Accounts. In fact, it is the basis of checking of Final Accounts, on which basis the auditor prepares his report.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowledge of Errors and Frauds</h4>
<p>Through this, the errors, frauds and misappropriation of accounts are known.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowing Errors in Posting</h4>
<p>Generally, the chances of mistake are more in ledger, in accounting work. By routine checking it can be known, whether the work of ledger posting is done properly or not.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tracing out Change in Figures</h4>
<p>Various secret Ticks and Marks are used during the process. If any change is made in figures after the checking, it can be easily traced.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demerits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Carelessness in Work</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is not of any specific ability, thus, it is done by junior employees. These junior employees take routine check as a mere formality and finish the work quickly and carelessly, due to which chances of various mistakes remaining undetected are there. In fact, this fault is not of routine check but of the persons doing the work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Errors of Principle remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Persons doing routine checking are not much qualified, thus they do not have full knowledge of the Principles of Accounting. Thus, the errors of principle of accounting remain undetected.</li>
<li>
<h4>Monotonous Work</h4>
<p>Since, the work of routine checking goes on in a continuous process, the employees get bored in their work and they don’t take interest in their work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cleverly done Frauds remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Small mathematical and other inaccuracies can be known through this technique, but cleverly and intelligently planned big frauds cannot be known.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Routine Checking</h2>
<p>Whether a business is big or small, the record of its daily transactions is kept in the books of accounts. The daily checking of these books of accounts under audit is called <em>Routine Checking</em>. Usually this work is done by the junior staff of the auditor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking-merits-demerits/">Merits and Demerits of Routine Checking</a> are also discussed in later articles.</p>
<p><span id="more-93"></span></p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Objectives Of Routine Checking</h3>
<p>The routine serves the following objectives</p>
<ol>
<li>To know the mathematical accuracy of the accounts, entered in the primary books of accounts.</li>
<li>To know the regularity of accounting in primary books of accounts.</li>
<li>By making use of distinct Ticks and Marks to know that no changes are made in figures after the check.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ticks And Marks Used In Routine Checking</h2>
<p>While doing routine checking, some signs of different colors are used. These are called Ticks or Check Marks. The main points related to this are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Precautions</h4>
<p>The following precautions must be taken while using these marks</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark should be small and clear.</li>
<li>Marks should not be of the same color in which accounts are written.</li>
<li>Different colors of marks must be used for different activities.</li>
<li>Marks must be changed each year.</li>
<li>The meanings of marks must be kept secret.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Place of Ticks and Marks</h4>
<p>The place of making the mark must be decided beforehand because along with the colors, types of marks, the place of its use are also very important. Usually for verifying the postings in accounts, mark is made on the left side of the amount. On checking the voucher with the amount, mark is made on the right side. On verifying the total, mark is made below the total etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Importance of Ticks and Marks</h4>
<p>The Ticks and Marks have great importance in verification. Prof. Emerson while expressing the importance of Ticks &amp; Marks has written that during audit, Ticks and Marks must be kept in mind, in the same way as while walking, we keep track of the road in mind, while talking we keep words in mind and while shopping pocket kept in mind. In all these situations, a little carelessness creates various problems.</li>
