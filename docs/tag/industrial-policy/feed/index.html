								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Industrial Development In Developing Countries</h2>
<p>In developed countries there are several favorable conditions for Industrial Development, but in poor and developing countries there are several problems in its development. Even after some significant developments in the field of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">Industrialization in India</a>, the country is still agricultural country and 38% of the national income and 70% of the population depends on the land.<br />
<span id="more-111"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Suppression of Industrial Disputes</h4>
<div id="attachment_137" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-image-137 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/labor-300x202.jpg" alt="Industrial Development" width="300" height="202" /><p id="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-caption-text">A child working in an auto-parts unit, making wheels for automobiles. Poor economic growth, along with staggering food prices and a slowdown in industrial production, leaves the RBI baffled, while civilians live hand-to-mouth and struggle to make ends meet.</p></div>
<p>It is completely true that a satisfied labor is a valuable wealth of an organisation. A satisfactory and efficient system of arbitration of Industrial disputes is very necessary. Through the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 efforts are made to establish Industrial peace but it is insufficient. Efforts should be made to popularize the Group Discussion method. The policy of worker’s participation in management should be strictly followed. The reasons for the disputes should be analysed impartially and methods should be developed accordingly for their solution.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Research and Technology</h4>
<p>In developed countries, continuous research is done on industrial problems and production processes etc. New avenues of development are explored through research on scientific and technical subjects. Now.work has been started on this subject here also.</li>
<li>
<h4>Increase in Power Resources</h4>
<p>India has insufficient power resources. Thus, expansion of power resources and establishment of new units should be done. The government should pay attention to this side to encourage industrial development. Power cuts have to be done from time to time which adversely affects production. Thus, solution of this problem is necessary.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper Use of Natural Resources</h4>
<p>India has sufficient natural resources but due to their improper use industrial development has not been done. Thus, for industrial development proper use of natural resources is necessary. Those areas should be explored where possibilities of industrial development are more.</li>
<li>
<h4>Establishment of Specialized Institutions</h4>
<p>Much importance has been paid to establishment of specialized organizations and institutions to provide steadiness to industrial development. Various institutions are established in several states for the development of special Industries, but various other organisations are required in relation to this.</li>
<li>
<h4>Efficient System of Industrial Management</h4>
<p>Educated and skilled managers are required to run the industrial organisations properly, who are able to understand the complicated problems of industrialization and solve them quickly.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encourage Capital Formation</h4>
<p>For industrial development funds are very necessary, though India completely lacks it. Thus, savings should be encouraged more for capital formation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encouragement to Private Sector</h4>
<p>The government should provide more and more facilities to the private sector so that the entrepreneurs come forward to invest more and new industries can be established and old industries are modernized.</li>
<li>
<h4>Earnings in Foreign Exchange</h4>
<p>India lacks funds completely. Thus, to establish Industries in India, foreign investors should be attracted. For this, government should provide them better facilities. In this way, new industries would be established, unemployment would be eliminated and foreign exchange be earned.</li>
<li>
<h4>Rational Taxation Policy</h4>
<p>A proper taxation policy also has an important place in industrial development. Inappropriate taxation, causes problems for industrial organisations, in their development. It is necessary that the needed areas have a liberal taxation policy to motivate them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>INDUSTRIAL POLICY, 1991</h2>
<div id="attachment_147" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147" class="size-medium wp-image-147" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kurien-202x300.jpg" alt="Industrial Policy 1991" width="202" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-147" class="wp-caption-text">Professor P. J. Kurien of Vennikulam, Kerala, is a political and social worker, teacher and educationist. He known for Industrial Policy, 1991.</p></div>
<p>In order to accelerate <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrial-development/">Industrial Development in India</a>, and in accordance with the changing circumstances, various industrial policies were declared in the years 1948, 1956, 1977, 1980 and 1985, but in spite of all efforts, the pace and as well as the level of Industrial Development in India, could not reached according to its need. Therefore, in order to lift unnecessary restrictions on Industries, under the licensing policy, and to increase their efficiency, development and technological level, in order to make Indian goods usable in the competitive global market, on 24th July, 1991, in Lok-Sabha the Minister of States for industries, Mr. P. J. Kurian declared the <strong>Industrial Policy, 1991.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-52"></span></p>
<h3>OBJECTIVES OF NEW INDUSTRIAL POLICY, 1991</h3>
<ol>
<li>To liberalise the economy</li>
<li>To increase employment opportunities</li>
<li>To encourage foreign assistance and co-partnership</li>
<li>To make the Public Sector more competitive</li>
<li>To increase the production and productivity, give encouragement to industries</li>
<li>To liberate the economy from various government restrictions</li>
<li>Industrial development of backward areas</li>
<li>To give liberty to private sector to work independently</li>
<li>To make development for modem competitive economy</li>
<li>To give encouragement for expansion of production capacity</li>
<li>To increase exports and liberalize (facilitate) imports.</li>
</ol>
<h2>SALIENT FEATURES OF NEW INDUSTRIAL POLICY, 1991</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Liberalized Industrial Licensing Policy</h4>
<p>Under this policy, with the exception of 18 industries, licensing system has been removed for all other industries. Some of those 18 industries, where the licensing system is still mandatory are; Army and Defence, Forest Conservation, Industries engaged in manufacturing goods which are harmful to the Environment and industries, which are manufacturing luxury goods, for the affluent (very rich) class, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Localisation Policy</h4>
<p>Those industries which are situated in cities, where the population is less than 1 million, industrial permission from the government, to start any industry is not required. In cities having population of more than 1 million, with the exception of electronics and other pollution free industries, all industrial units may be 25 kilo meters away from the city’s boundary.</li>
<li>
<h4>Foreign Investment</h4>
<p>Provision has been made to invest up to 51 percent by foreign investors in the equity shares of Indian Companies. Earlier, this limit was limited up to 40% only. This will increase the flow of foreign capital into India and make possible technical exchange from developed countries.</li>
<li>
<h4>Workers’ Participation in Management</h4>
<p>Under this industrial policy, emphasis has been laid on safeguarding the workers’ interest. Provision has been made for workers’ participation in management, in order to manage sick units, provision has been made to form co-operative societies of workers, to run them.</li>
<li>
<h4>Role of Public Sector</h4>
<p>Those public sector undertakings which are not doing well at present, but in which there are enough chances of improvement, shall be re-constituted. Public sector undertakings, which are facing constant financial crisis, shall be kept under observation by ‘Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction’ or by any other institution, which is fixed by the government.</li>
<li>
<h4>Change in the MRTP Act</h4>
<p>In the industrial policy 1991, major changes have been made in the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice Act</span></em>. Companies having investment of Rs. 100 crores, will not be required to take prior Government permission, for opening new subdivisions, or to expand the present industry or for amalgamation of companies. This industrial policy has also eliminated the investment limit, which was fixed by MRTP Act.</li>
<li>
<h4>Creation of Productive Capacity</h4>
<p>In order to increase the productive capacity of new industries, all administrative controls have been removed. Industrialists will only have to inform the government of opening of new units or increasing their production capacity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Promotion of Industries in Rural Areas</h4>
<p>In order to remove the regional imbalances, under this industrial policy, various provisions have been made to encourage industries in rural areas.</li>
<li>
<h4>Foreign Technology</h4>
<p>No prior permission from government will be required in importing foreign technology, up to the limit of One Crore rupees. Indian companies, will be free to negotiate their terms and conditions, with their foreign collaborators, in matters of technology transfers (exchange of ‘technical know-how).</li>
<li>
<h4>Reservation of Small Scale Industries</h4>
<p>This policy has stated that the government shall keep giving assistance to small scale industries. The limit for small scale industries has been reduced from Rs 3 Crores to Rs. 1 Crore, since 24 December, 1999.</li>
</ol>
