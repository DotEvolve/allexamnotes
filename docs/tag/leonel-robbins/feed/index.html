								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Similarities Between The Definition Of Marshall And Robbins</h2>
<p>The following similarities are found in the definitions Of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Prof Marshall</a> and <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">Prof Robbins</a><span id="more-332"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Prof. Marshall used the word &#8216;wealth&#8217;, in his definition, whereas; Prof. Robbins has related Economics with &#8216;limited means&#8217; (or scarcity). Therefore, there is similarity in the views of both because wealth is that object or service, whose supply is limited. Thus, Prof. Robbins limited resource (scarcity) statement, is another form of money.</li>
<li>Both the intellectuals consider Economics as a science. In this way, there is similarity in the views of Marshall and Robbins on this matter.</li>
<li>According to Prof Robbins, the utilization of resources must be done economically, so that production or satisfaction becomes maximum. Marshall has expressed the same view, as &#8216;material welfare&#8217; or &#8216;human welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>The ancient Economists had considered Economics as the Science of Wealth, which was interpreted as man is for money, instead of that money is for man. In this manner, the main subject matter of Economics was considered, as wealth and not man. Marshall used the word &#8216;Mankind&#8217; and Robbins used words like &#8216;Human Behavior&#8217;, clearly stated that in Economics, man has an important place instead of wealth.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Differences Between The Definition Of Marshall And Robbins</h2>
<p>The definitions of Prof. Marshall and Prof. Robbins have the following dissimilarities</p>
<ol>
<li>Marshall definition is simple and an. ordinary person. can easily understand it. From this point of view, it is practical, but Robbins definition is so much theoretical, that is why, it is very difficult and beyond the understanding power of ordinary people.</li>
<li>According to Prof. Marshall, Economics has a close relation with &#8216;Human Welfare&#8217;, whereas; according to Robbins, Economics is not related to any &#8216;Welfare&#8217; or &#8216;Non-welfare&#8217;.</li>
<li>Marshall presented Economics in the form of both a science and an art, but Robbins accepted it only in the form of a real science.</li>
<li>Marshall has considered Economics as a &#8216;social science&#8217;. According to him, it studies only the activities of social, normal and real persons, whereas; according to Robbins, it studies the both socialistic and sole (aloof), in this way, it is a human science.</li>
<li>Marshall has said that Economics studies only those activities, which are related to wealth and which can be measured in money, whereas; Robbins has said that Economics also studies those activities, which have no relation which money, like &#8211; the study of activities related to &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Which Definition is Superior?</h3>
<p>It is difficult to say which definition between Marshall&#8217;s and Robbins is superior. Actually both definitions are complementary to each other. Marshall&#8217;s definition is easier having a practical view, whereas; Robbins definition has theoretical view point. Both Economists have seen the same thing, from different angles. In Marshall&#8217;s view, wealth is in the form of prime means, whereas; Prof. Robbins has taken in his views, &#8216;scarce resources&#8217;, instead of &#8216;wealth&#8217;. From theoretical point of view, if, Robbins definition is superior, while from practical point of view, Marshall&#8217;s definition is superior.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Criticism Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">Robbins definition</a> could be criticized in a way that it does not practically applicable, it provide only a theoretical view.<span id="more-321"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unnecessary Enlargement of the Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>Robbins&#8217;s definition has unnecessarily widened the scope of economics. According to Robbins, any activity of choosing, whether it is economic or not, comes under the scope of economics. Example &#8211; If a student thinks of choosing between studies and cinema, this activity of decision making will also come under the scope of economics. But critics are of the opinion that uneconomic activities should not be included in economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Neutrality of Ends</h4>
<p>In Robbins view, it is the duty of the economist to explore and explain and riot to support or criticize. Thus, economics is neutral between ends and the economist is not concerned with, what is right and what is wrong. But this view of Robbins is highly criticized.</li>
<li>
<h4>Based on Theoretical View</h4>
<p>In Robbins view, there is no place for humanity, and human welfare and his definition lacks practicality. Thus, we can only call it a theoretical view. Such economics which cannot be applied in practical life, it does not retain any utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Applicable only on a Few Countries</h4>
<p>Robbins definition is applicable in only those countries where Barter Exchange System is prevalent. In a barter less economy, Robbins economics will prove a waste because in such an economy, no question arises of scarcity and decision related problems.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unrealistic Assumption</h4>
<p>Robbins believes that each individual does only that activities from which he derives maximum satisfaction. But in practical life, an individual does not always compare the satisfaction he derives from different activities but usually he acts without thinking so much. Thus, this assumption of Robbins is unrealistic.</li>
<li>
<h4>Fixed Economic Laws</h4>
<p>According to Robbins definition, economic laws are as certain fixed, stable and true as the rules of natural sciences. in this context we must not forget that human behavior keeps changing with time and economic laws are concerned with humans only. Thus, economics laws and principles do not remain so stable under variable conditions, as Robbins states.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction Of Robbins</h3>
<div id="attachment_319" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-image-319 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/robbins-1-1.jpg" alt="Robbins definition of Economics" width="220" height="289" /><p id="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-caption-text">Prof Lionel Robbins</p></div>
<p>Robbins definition of Economics challenged Dr.<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/"> Marshall definition of Economics</a> which was a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. Before Prof. Lionel Robbins, Prof. Marshall tried to give complete and faultless definition of economics. At that time people started thinking that the Economic Science has completely develop and matured. But in 1932, after the publication of Prof. Robbins&#8217;s book <strong><em>An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Social Science</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">a controversy roused in the field of Economics</a>. He tried to give economics another shape, apart from material welfare. In the words of Robbins</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relation between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<h2>Characteristics Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p>Following are the main characteristics of Robbins&#8217; definition</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unlimited Wants</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins definition, human wants are unlimited. On satisfaction of one wants, another want arises immediately.and this sequence continues forever.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scarce Means</h4>
<p>Robbins definition stated that through on one side human needs are unlimited yet on the other side, the means to satisfy these wants, like- time, power, money etc. are also limited. Due to this, many of man&#8217;s needs remain unsatisfied.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alternative Use of Scarce Means</h4>
<p>In Robbins&#8217;s view though the to &#8216;satisfy man&#8217;s needs are scarce, yet he has alternative uses. In other words, he can use every resource in various objectives and activities. For example &#8211; such a resource like land can be use in many ways, such as it can be used for agriculture or for building a house or to established a factory etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Variation in the Intensity of wants</h4>
<p>Robbins definition states that the intensity of man&#8217;s needs is different. Some wants are more intense than the others. Since our means are limited and all wants cannot be satisfied with the limited means; as a result, we have to select some more intense wants from our unlimited wants and the less intense wants have to be either dropped or postponed to a future date.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Criticism Of Marshall Definition</h2>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-288 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg" alt="Alfred Marshall" width="213" height="300" />The <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/">Dr. Marshall definition of Economics</a> is a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. This definition was recognized between 1890 to 1932 and it seemed that the controversy relating to the definition of Economics had ended. But, a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science&#8217; in 1932 criticized Marshall&#8217;s definition in loud words, which are as follows &#8211;<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Illusion of Anti-Immateriality</h4>
<p>Dr Marshall has restricted the relation of Economics only to the attainment of material resources and its consumption, whereas, Economics also includes the immaterial resources like services of advocates, teachers and other employees. That is the reason Robin said</p>
<blockquote><p>The Economist who keeps in mind only material study, cannot save themselves from the blame of being biased to one aspect.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Vagueness of Ordinary Business Activity</h4>
<p>The phrase used by Dr. Marshall, &#8220;The activities relating to the ordinary business of life is unclear and vague, because it is not cleat, what activities of man corm under ordinary business and winch activities are outside its area.&#8221; According to Prof. Robbins, though there are several such activities which come under an ordinary business of life, yet are studied in Economics, like &#8211; study of economy at the time of war, conditions of Imperfect Competition, Monopoly, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unclear Economic Activities</h4>
<p>Marshall has divided human activities in two parts, Economic and Non-economic, which is unfair because a similar activity of man can be economic and non-economic also at different times. Like &#8211; sweeping his own house by a servant is a non-economic activity, while sweeping his employer&#8217;s house. becomes an economic activity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unfair to Relies Economics with Human Welfare</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins, Economics has no relation with human welfare, Under this, all kind of activities must be studied, whether it is related to human welfare or not. He gives the following arguments to prove this</p>
<ul>
<li>Production and consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants It not ,beneficial for human welfare, still it is studied in Economics.</li>
<li>Human welfare is not a definite idea; It keeps changing according to time, place and conditions.</li>
<li>Human welfare cannot be measured in quantitative terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is not only a Social Science but also Human Science</h4>
<p>Prof. Marshall has restricted the field of Economics, by calling it only a social science. On the contrary, according to Prof. Robbins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is a human science, whose basic rules apply to an insane, miser, sage or Mahatma in the same mariner, as it applies to all the persons living in a society.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Scope of Economics</h4>
<p>The welfare definitions have restricted the scope of Economics because according to these definitions only material, ordinary and economic activities are studied in Economics. All other activities are outside the scope of Economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is Neutral between Objectives</h4>
<p>According to Robbins, &#8220;Economics is neutral against objectives. Objectives may be good and also bad, but this has no relation with Economics.&#8221; In his book, Prof. Robbins writes, &#8220;Whatever Economics is concerned with; it is not concerned with the causes of material welfare&#8221;.</li>
<li>
<h4>Economics is a Real Science</h4>
<p>On the basis of the definition of Marshall, Economics has become an ideal science, whereas; according to Robbins, &#8220;<strong>Economics is a real science and not an ideal science</strong>&#8220;.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above criticisms, it is clear that Marshall&#8217;s definition is narrow and unscientific, and is stuck in the net of immateriality.</p>
<p>Even after the above criticisms, Marshall&#8217;s definition is still a source of inspiration, to the readers. Economists, like &#8211; <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/keynesian-theory/">J.M. Keynes</a>, Hyne and Newman etc. consider Marshall yet as a &#8220;Great knowledgeable Economist&#8221;</p>
