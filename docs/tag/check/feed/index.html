								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have already discussed about purpose and objectives of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking/">Routine Checking</a>. In this article we will go through some merits and demerits of <em>Routine Checking</em>.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-196"></span></p>
<h2>Merits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Mathematical Accuracy</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" /> The mathematical mistakes of the books of accounts are known from this type of checking, it confirms that the accounts are mathematically accurate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is very easy. It can be done even by a person of ordinary abilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Basis of Final Checking</h4>
<p>It also helps in the checking of Trial Balance and Final Accounts. In fact, it is the basis of checking of Final Accounts, on which basis the auditor prepares his report.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowledge of Errors and Frauds</h4>
<p>Through this, the errors, frauds and misappropriation of accounts are known.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowing Errors in Posting</h4>
<p>Generally, the chances of mistake are more in ledger, in accounting work. By routine checking it can be known, whether the work of ledger posting is done properly or not.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tracing out Change in Figures</h4>
<p>Various secret Ticks and Marks are used during the process. If any change is made in figures after the checking, it can be easily traced.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demerits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Carelessness in Work</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is not of any specific ability, thus, it is done by junior employees. These junior employees take routine check as a mere formality and finish the work quickly and carelessly, due to which chances of various mistakes remaining undetected are there. In fact, this fault is not of routine check but of the persons doing the work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Errors of Principle remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Persons doing routine checking are not much qualified, thus they do not have full knowledge of the Principles of Accounting. Thus, the errors of principle of accounting remain undetected.</li>
<li>
<h4>Monotonous Work</h4>
<p>Since, the work of routine checking goes on in a continuous process, the employees get bored in their work and they don’t take interest in their work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cleverly done Frauds remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Small mathematical and other inaccuracies can be known through this technique, but cleverly and intelligently planned big frauds cannot be known.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Meaning Of Internal Check</h2>
<p>Internal check system is a part of the internal control system of the business. This is also called <em>Internal Block</em>. Each trader wants that he should be able to control the internal activities of his business, in such a manner that he can get maximum profits and the. chances of mistakes, fraud, etc., are could be minimum. The system of internal check is one such arrangement, in which the activities of employees are divided in such a manner that the work of one employee is independently checked by the other employee. Unless all employees of the organisation are become united, the chances of fraud etc., is not there.</p>
<p><span id="more-91"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-medium wp-image-265" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/internal-check-300x202.jpg" alt="Internal Check" width="300" height="202" /><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">Internal Check</p></div>
<p>For example – Suppose a customer presents a cheque of ₹1000 to the bank for payment. If all the works of checking the cheque, its investigation, its entry in books of accounts and payment of that cheque are done by a single bank employee, then he can by increasing a zero in ₹1000, make it ₹10000 in the bank books, give payment of ₹1000 only to the customer and can keep himself inappropriately the balance of ₹9000.</p>
<p>If the work of encashment of cheques is divided among three employees, one shall investigate the cheque, and make entries in the books of accounts. Second employee shall check this entry and send it to the third employee making cheque payments. The third employee shall make payment to the customer. In this system a single work is divided among three persons, and the work of first employee is automatically (without any special efforts) checked by the second employee, and the third employee shall make the payment of ₹1000 written in the cheque. In such a case, misappropriation cannot happen, unless all three employees unite.</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>According to Spicer and Pegler</p>
<blockquote><p>The internal check is such a system of management of a business, in which the work which is to be done by the employees is divided by the organisation in such a manner, that no employee can do the written accounting work of a transaction from the beginning to the end, and the work of each employee is also surely and independently checked by another employee, so that without any joint and pre-planned efforts of all employees, the happening of mistakes and frauds becomes impossible, and if any mistake occurs, it is immediately detected at the time of accounting, by another employee.</p></blockquote>
