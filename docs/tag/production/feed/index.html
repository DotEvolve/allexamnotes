								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Marketing</h2>
<p><em>Agricultural marketing refers to all those processes which relate to taking the agricultural product from the farmers to the consumers. Agricultural marketing includes gathering the agricultural produce, their standardization and grading, their storage, sending them to the market through various middlemen, selling in the market and arranging the required finance etc.</em></p>
<h3>Defects/Problems Of Indian Agricultural Marketing</h3>
<p>Even though India is an agricultural country, still its agricultural marketing has been defective. The Indian farmers are unable to get reasonable price for the products even after their hard work and are fully exploited by the middlemen.<span id="more-251"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Too Many Intermediates</h4>
<div id="attachment_252" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252" class="size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fruit_vegetable_market-300x200.jpg" alt="Agricultural Marketing" width="300" height="200" /><p id="caption-attachment-252" class="wp-caption-text">Fruit &amp; Vegetables Market</p></div>
<p>The one main defect of the Indian Agricultural marketing is the presence of too many middlemen and exploitation of farmers by them. On one hand these middlemen exploit the farmers by purchasing the produce at lower prices and on the other hand they exploit the customers by demanding higher prices from them. The only aim of a number of commission agents, brokers etc. is to derive a higher income from the middle processes. These middlemen take undue advantage of the poor former on the basis of their financial resources.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Weights and Scales</h4>
<p>One of the biggest defects of agricultural marketing arises due to weights and scales. Usually, in rural areas bricks, etc. are used as weights and in urban markets also defective weights are found. Thus, the grain of the farmer is weighed by a heavier weight for their own gain. Most of the traders keep separate weights for purchase and sale of grain.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy and Lack of Unity among Farmers</h4>
<p>The Indian farmers are illiterate who are easier be fooled by the money lenders, traders, middlemen, due to their simple nature. Similarly, lack of unity among farmers also causes their exploitation because Indian farmers are spread in distant areas in rural places. They are unable to meet with each other and resolve their problems, as a result they do not get a fair price for their produce.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Financial Resources</h4>
<p>In the rural areas there is lack of financial resources, due to which even their emergency requirements are not fulfilled. In such conditions the farmers sell their produce before its ripening. Similarly, some financial facilities, like, installments on loans for pumping-set, tractor, thrasher etc. have to be paid on monthly or quarterly basis due to which they have to sell the product as soon as possible. Thus, as the lack of financial assistance, is a problem for the farmers; so does the receipt of loan also puts them in problem.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Organised Marketing System</h4>
<p>The agricultural marketing is also very defective in India because here organised marketing is not in vogue, like, cooperative societies, government marketing activities, regular markets etc. As a result, the farmer remains entangled In exploitation. Thus, lack of organised marketing system is harmful for the farmers. That is -why; the farmer sells his product personally to different people. The middle take full advantage of the unorganized farmers.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Transport Facilities</h4>
<p>The roads from Villages to cities are usually unmade which are not capable of transport during the rainy season. The bullock carts can take the product only up to a limited area. During lack of transport facilities the farmer is unable to take his produce to the appropriate market and is unable to receive a fair price for his product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Store Houses</h4>
<p>An important deficiency of Indian agricultural marketing is lack of store houses. Due to lack of this facility the farmer is unable to keep his product safely until it can fetch a fair price, and he is forced to sell his product at a low price. The insufficient and unscientific facilities of shortage which are available, waste large quantities of grains. Approximately 20% to 30% grains are lost due to rats, insects etc. and the farmers have to bear crores of loss due to lack of these facilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Standardization</h4>
<p>The lack of standardization and grading is clearly visible in the Indian Agricultural marketing, due to which fixing a deal in relation to these products becomes difficult. Due to lack of proper standardization and grading the customers have problem in purchasing the product.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Awareness of the Market</h4>
<p>The Indian farmer has no knowledge about marketing. He believes on information acquired from the businessmen and money lenders of the village. Mostly, the Indian farmers are illiterate so they cannot read the newspaper. Thus, they do not have sufficient knowledge about the market. Now, government transmits the rates of the market on the ratio, which has definitely benefited them.</li>
<li>
<h4>Corrupt Policies of the ‘Mandis’</h4>
<p>If we observe the condition of the mandis, this fact is no more hidden that the middlemen and the traders jointly make fool the simple farmers. The Indian Organizing Society has clarified the following facts relating to the corrupt policies of the mandis</p>
<ul>
<li>The inappropriate marketing system is so deep laden in India that about 5% of the amount is deducted from the farmer’s produce in the name of donations, ‘dharmada’, ‘chanda’ etc.</li>
<li>The farmers are paid low price, as they lack appropriate knowledge about market prices, their fluctuations, government policies etc. Thus, by keeping the rates secret, the farmers are cheated.</li>
<li>Before the sale, large amounts of grains are taken from the farmers as samples. By declaring the product to be of sub standard quality minimum prices are paid for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<p>The Indian agricultural labor spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.<span id="more-246"></span></p>
<h2>Suggested Remedies Of The Problems</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Distribution of Land</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-247 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/indian-agricuture-problems-300x199.jpg" alt="Agricultural Labor Problems" width="300" height="199" />It has always been the effort of the government that whatever additional land is available, it be distributed among the landless. The government has also made efforts to distribute the barren land after making it usable or fertile to theseagricultural labor . It is estimated that till now about more than 10 million agricultural laborers have been provided with land.</li>
<li>
<h4>Industrialization in Villages</h4>
<p>Village <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/industrialization/">industrialization</a> has been given specific importance during the planning period. The object of this program is to reduce the dependency on agriculture and revive the cottage and small industries in villages.</li>
<li>
<h4>To Spread Education</h4>
<p>To solve the various problems and difficultiesagricultural labor education should be encouraged, so that they can restrict the exploitation of landowners, calculate their correct wages and contribute in the revolutions undergoing in agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Development of Cooperative labor</h4>
<p>To improve the conditions of agricultural labor the expansion of labor cooperative societies is being encouraged, but more development is necessary. In government tenders the labor Cooperative Societies are always given preference.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improvement in Working Conditions</h4>
<p>The working conditions of agricultural laborer should be improved. They should be provided rests and vacations.</li>
<li>
<h4>Regulation of working Hours</h4>
<p>Similar, to the industrial laborers, the working hours of agricultural laborers should also be fixed. Additional wage payment system should be there on working for more than the fixed time.</li>
<li>
<h4>Elimination of slavery</h4>
<p>The Indian constitution has declared Agricultural slavery as crime, so that agricultural laborers are not exploited. Its strict compliance is necessary.</li>
<li>
<h4>Organisations of Agricultural Laborers</h4>
<p>Like the industrial laborers, organisations should also be established for agricultural laborers so that the laborers are able to safeguard their rights. Moreover, labor warfare centers should be established by these organisations at the block levels. At these centers, the entertainment and general education facilities should be available for the laborer.</li>
<li>
<h4>Employment scheme</h4>
<p>This scheme was started in 1971 with a view to provide employment facilities to agricultural laborers. It has been implemented by the government in various forms.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shelter for Landless Laborer</h4>
<p>Science 1971, a scheme to provide shelter to landless laborers is going on. The total expenditure incurred on this program is met by the Central Government.</li>
<li>
<h4>Minimum Wage Act</h4>
<p>The Minimum Wage Act of 1984 has also been implemented on agricultural laborers. In the 14th summit of Indian Labor conference, it was decided that the state government can implement the minimum wages anytime. The minimum wages of agricultural labor in various states like – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, etc. has already been fixed.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Agricultural Labor</h2>
<p>Agricultural labor is that person who works on another land, does not participate in farm management and its maintenance, and receives money or a portion of the harvest in consideration for his service. He neither has any rights regarding the land, nor does he have to bear any risk regarding the farm. Briefly by agricultural labor we mean’ such laborers who <em><strong>“earn their livelihood by working on agricultural farms.”</strong></em></p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>According to Second Agricultural Labor Investigation society</p>
<blockquote><p>Agricultural labor refers to that person who receives more than half of the income from agriculture. The agricultural labor family refers to that family, whose more than half of the income from agriculture.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Problems of Agricultural Labor in India</h2>
<div id="attachment_234" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-234" class="size-medium wp-image-234" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agri_labor-300x220.jpg" alt="Agricultural Labor" width="300" height="220" /><p id="caption-attachment-234" class="wp-caption-text">Agricultural Labor</p></div>
<p>Describing the conditions of Indian agricultural labor P.T.Mayya writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Indian laborer spends his days in dirt and mud. He produces food grains for us but remains hungry himself. He feeds our cows but never gets anything but water. He fills our stores with food grains, but begs his own ration for the whole year. He continuously chops woods and fills water for those who have become rich on behalf of his labor. His condition is heart wrenching and Piteous.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Excess Working Hours</h4>
<p>The working hours of these laborer are not only irregular but also excessive. They have to work since morning to late night. His working hours change with harvest, season and work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Seasonal Employment</h4>
<p>The agricultural labor does not get work for the whole year. According to the Second Agricultural Labor Investigation Society, a Seasonal labor gets an average of 197 days of work in a year. Similarly, child labor gets 204 days and women get 141 days of employment. Thus, their average annual income is very lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Low Wages</h4>
<p>The wage level of agricultural labors very low as compared to that of industrial labor. It has two reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in landless laborers</li>
<li>lack of non-agricultural areas of work in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Agricultural Slavery</h4>
<p>Majority of agricultural laborers are landless and of backward classes. Due to their lower social status they are treated as animals. Big land owners make them work as slaves. They are used as laborers and in return given minimum wages.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indebtedness</h4>
<p>Due to lower income, the indebtedness of agricultural farmers is increasing. They hesitate in negotiating their wages with the land owners in the fear that their services would be terminated. The laborers remain indebted even after working with the land owners for their whole life.</li>
<li>
<h4>Not United</h4>
<p>Since the agricultural laborers are spread in millions of village all over the country they lack unity. Thus, they are unable to negotiate their wages etc. with the land owners by uniting themselves.</li>
<li>
<h4>Exploitation of Child and Women Laborers</h4>
<p>Due to lower income the children and women of agricultural laborers are also forced to work for their livelihood. The child and women laborers are made to work more for livelihood. Thus, exploitation of child labor and woman labor is a major problem in the field of agriculture.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lower Social Status</h4>
<p>Most of the agricultural laborers are of backward classes who have been exploited since centuries. Due to this reason also their social status is lower.</li>
<li>
<h4>Shortage of Other Jobs</h4>
<p>There is shortage of other jobs in villages. Thus, if the crop is destroyed by floods, famines etc., it becomes difficult for the agricultural labor to survive.</li>
<li>
<h4>Housing Problem</h4>
<p>The landless laborers have no private house. They live in cottages, made on the useless land of the landowners with their permission and in its return they have to work without payment, for the landowners. When a number of people live under the same root, the physical, social, moral and religious problem arises.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unemployment due to mechanization</h4>
<p>At the present times, due to increase in the use of machines, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/01/unemployment-india/">unemployment</a> rate among the illiterate agricultural farmers is increasing, which is a serious problem for them.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Agricultural Productivity?</h2>
<p>Agricultural productivity (<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/04/low-agricultural-productivity-india/">Low Agricultural Productivity In India</a>) is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult.<span id="more-230"></span></p>
<h3>Suggestions For Problem Of Low Productivity in India</h3>
<p>While agricultural production so low in India here are few measures that could be taken to overcome this problem in near future. Following are some suggestions to deal with the problem of low production in India.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Expansion of Credit Facilities</h4>
<p>To increase agricultural productivity, it is essential that the credit facilities be appropriately expanded. This would help the farmers fulfill their short term, medium term and long term financial requirements easily. All efforts should be made to provide credit facility to farmers quickly and economically.</li>
<li>
<h4>Education and Training of Farmer</h4>
<p>Through education and training, the farmers should be encouraged to improve the farming techniques, use scientific methods to increase productivity and enhance their skills. Proper education system would eliminate superstition, conservatism and ignorance among farmers and it would be easier to increase the productivity by the development of these human qualities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Improvement of Irrigation Facilities</h4>
<div id="attachment_231" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231" class="size-medium wp-image-231" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/irrigation-300x204.jpg" alt="Agricultural Productivity" width="300" height="204" /><p id="caption-attachment-231" class="wp-caption-text">The Narmada Main Canal is the largest irrigation lined canal in the world, supplying water at a capacity of 1,133 cubic meters a second.</p></div>
<p>Indian agriculture is called a gamble of rains. This condition should quickly end. A network of irrigation facilities should be spread. The small irrigation plans and the wells and tube-wells system should be expanded on a preference basis.</li>
<li>
<h4>Plant Protection Scheme</h4>
<p>Arrangements should be made to protect the plants from insects and diseases. More insecticides should be manufactured and arrangements should be made to increase their use. Development of research work relating to diseases should be done to benefit from these researches.</li>
<li>
<h4>Technical Suggestions</h4>
<p>To increase the agricultural productivity it is necessary to have a technical service system for scientific solution for production problems. Agricultural productivity can be increased on the basis of these technical suggestions.</li>
<li>
<h4>Expansion of Marketing Facilities</h4>
<p>Making the marketing system better and lawful to remove its defects would increase productivity. When the farmers would receive fair price for their labor, then they will perform the production activity and more skillfully.</li>
<li>
<h4>Encouragement to Cooperative Farming</h4>
<p>To increase productivity and make the agricultural system progressive, cooperative farming should be rapidly expanded. Cooperative farming would help the farmer correct the present uneconomical methods of farming.</li>
<li>
<h4>Population control</h4>
<p>Necessary effort should be made in the direction of reducing the pressure of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/03/population-problem-solution/">high population</a> on agricultural land.</li>
<li>
<h4>Health Improvement</h4>
<p>Effective efforts should be made in improvement of the health of farmers. System of proper and balanced diet and health facilities should be established. Only the healthy farmers can attain the objective of increasing productivity. Lack of efficiency of unhealthy farmers resulting in low productivity, it can be removed only by improvement in health facilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scientific Methods of Cultivation</h4>
<p>Cultivation methods should be improved and the should be scientifically carried out, crops should be properly distributed, techniques based on agricultural research should be adopted. All the activities like ploughing, sowing, irrigation etc. should be properly carried out, then only production can be increased.</li>
<li>
<h4>Proper and Quick Implementation of Land Reforms</h4>
<p>Proper and quick implementation of land reforms should be done, so that the farmers are encouraged to bring some basic improvements. Elimination of mediators and permanent ownership of land to farmers should be done immediately.</li>
<li>
<h4>To Initiate Crop Insurance Scheme</h4>
<p>Implementation of crop insurance Scheme would help in increasing agricultural productivity. By this, the farmers would not worry about the uncertainty of production and their income would become stable, by which they would be able to complete the production activity more sincerely.</li>

<p>Agricultural productivity is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to agricultural inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, their varying densities make measuring overall agricultural output difficult.<br />

<h3>Causes of Low Agricultural Productivity in India</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Heavy Burden of the Population</h4>
<p>In India, the <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/02/population-explosion-india/">burden of the population</a> is too much on the agricultural land; due to which the agricultural activity cannot be properly controlled. In India about 70% people are dependent on agriculture. The increasing burden of the population on agricultural land, is one of the main reasons for low productivity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Illiteracy, Superstition and Malnutrition</h4>
<p>The agricultural productivity depends much on efficiency,, skill and sincerity of human resources. In India, unfortunately, the human resources are suffering from various deficiencies, the Indian farmer is illiterate and superstitious, their health is also frail. In the environment of superstition and conservatism the backwardness and low productivity of agriculture is natural.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Social Organisation of Farmers</h4>
<p>The Indian Social organisation of the farmers has been defective. The casts system and joint family system have not provided that encouragement and power by which they can increase their productivity. Due to cast-ism,proper cooperation of all in the agricultural activity is not possible. The family tensions and differences have very much responsible for minimizing the productivity of the farmer.</li>
<li>
<h4>Traditional Methods of Farming</h4>
<p>In India, fanning is done by traditional methods even today. By using good seeds, fertilizers and modem machinery per hectare production can be increased. But, here the same old seeds and traditional methods of farming are used. For irrigation, the farmer still depends on monsoon. Due to the shortage of,stores, the farmer either sells his harvest in the fields or is forced to sell it at low prices, in the market.</li>
<li>
<h4>Size of Fields</h4>
<p>The average size of the fields in India is between 2 acres to 5 acres, which is too less. The agricultural field is not only less but also dispersed. In some areas the size of the field is so small that they cant even be ploughed easily. Due to the small size of the field, the machines etc. cannot be used on it and the farmers have to expand more labor, time and energy. Even of these circumstances, the land disputes between the farmers make them incur the major part of their income on court cases.</li>
<li>
<h4>Insufficient irrigation Facilities</h4>
<p>One of the major reasons of low agriculture productivity in India, is that the farmers still depend on rain and very few farmers have their own irrigation means. Like before partition the total irrigated area was 24%, but after partition it has fallen to 19%, even though the government has started big and medium irrigation schemes, during the planning period from time to time. Thus, now in the ratio of total land, the irrigated area has increased to 36%. This shows that India requires artificial irrigation methods.</li>
<li>
<h4>Uncertainty of Rain</h4>
<p>From the point of view of both time and result, rain is uncertain. Due to this reason Indian agriculture is called a gamble of rains. Scanty rainfall causes droughts, and heavy rains destroy the crops by floods.</li>
<li>
<h4>Faulty and Tenancy System</h4>
<p>Thogh the <i>“Zamidari System”</i> has ended in India and the Land Development Act has been implemented yet still most of the farmers have not been provided land. Since, they don’t have their own land, they do not work sincerely. Thus, productivity is low.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Good Quality manure</h4>
<p>The number of animals in India is so much that each year 165 crore tons of manure can be produced from their urine and dung. Other wastes and useless articles can produce 8.6 mega tons of manure. But, the valuable manure from cow-dung is dried and burned in case of shortage of wood. Thus, due to lack of good manure productivity decreases.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Finance</h4>
<p>The claims of loans have discouraged the Indian farmer. He lacks funds to buy good quality manure, seeds and machines. He fulfills his financial requirement by taking loans from the moneylender. The moneylender exploits him, taking advantage of his condition. Thus, the farmer unable to invest in agriculture. As a result production falls.</li>
<li>
<h4>Crop Diseases and Animals</h4>
<p>The crops get various diseases like termite, redcoat etc. which destroys the crop. Secondly, the various wild animals like Pigs, Neel-Gaye (wild-cows), etc. damage the standing crop. Thus, production falls.</li>
<li>
<h4>Defective Marketing</h4>
<p>One of the reasons of the backwardness of the Indian farmer is defective marketing system. Due to this defective marketing, the Indian farmer is unable to get a fair price for his produce, and as a result he is discouraged from performing his production activity, skillfully. Due to the defective marketing system,the farmers do not earn sufficient income and are unable to succeed in the agricultural activity.</li>
<li>
<h4>Decline in Fertility</h4>
<p>Decline in fertility is also responsible for lower productivity in India. Continuous agricultural activity on land has activated the Law of Diminishing Returns on it. No effective resolutions have been made to restrict continuity of this law.</li>
