<h2>INTRODUCTION OF LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY</h2>
<p>We know that wants of every man are unlimited. Wants arise again and again but man has limited means (income) to fulfill his wants and means have , alternative uses. Thus, man always face problem of distribution of limited means of alternative uses, on his wants; so that, he may get maximum satisfaction (or utility). Law of Equi-Marginal Utility presents the solution of this problem. This law states that if a person, wishes to get maximum satisfaction from his income, he should spend his income on different items, in such a way that the utility of last unit of money spent on each commodity, should be equal or almost equal. This law of consumption was propounded by a French Economist, H. H. Gossen in 1854 and it is also known as the <strong>Second Law of Gossen</strong>.<br />
<span id="more-416"></span></p>
<h3>DIFFERENT NAMES OF THE LAW</h3>
<p>Law of Equi-marginal utility is known with several names, such as; Law of Substitution, Law of Indifference, Law of Proportionality, Law of economy, etc.</p>
<h3>ASSUMPTIONS OF THE LAW</h3>
<p>The assumptions of this law are as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>Man (Consumer) is rational being and his aim is to get maximum satisfaction.</li>
<li>Marginal utility of money remains the same (equal).</li>
<li>Consumer spends his money in small quaritities.</li>
<li>Utility can be measured in the form of money.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Definition of Law of Equi-marginal Utility</h2>
<p>According to Gossen</p>
<blockquote><p>It is impossible to gratify all wants to the point of satisfaction. It is necessary, in order to obtain maximum satisfaction, to discontinue the satisfaction of different wants at a point at which their intensity has become equal.</p></blockquote>
<h3>EXPLANATION OF THE LAW</h3>
<div id="attachment_421" style="width: 186px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-421" class="wp-image-421 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gossen-1-1.jpg" alt="H. H. Gossen" width="176" height="248" /><p id="caption-attachment-421" class="wp-caption-text">Hermann Heinrich Gossen</p></div>
<p>Law of Equi-marginal utility has three main basis</p>
<ol>
<li>Wants of human (consumer) are uniimi,ted.</li>
<li>Man has limited means but these means can be used alternatively.</li>
<li>Every person wants to get maximum satisfaction (utility) from his limited means.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, consuming commodity continuously one by one; consumer gets the utility at diminishing rate from each next unit. So, when the consumer spends, his limited income, on different heads, to get maximum satisfaction, he compares the utility of successive units of different heads and replaces the commodity that gives less utility by the commodity that gives utility and this replacement continues, until the marginal utility becomes equal.</p>
<p>This law is highly <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-criticism-and-limitation/">criticized</a> by some of the economists, but its <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/02/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-importance-and-benefits/">importance</a> is also acknowledged by many of them.</p>
