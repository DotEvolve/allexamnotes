					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] India is recognized as a poor country even after around 70Â years of independence. Especially in the Rural Sector of India, the condition is worse. Though during the planning periods the national income of-India and the per ca-pita income has increased, social welfare has increased, literacy level has risen and people have been able to fulfill more and more of their requirements but poverty (and specially Rural Poverty) is still present in its alarming form. We have also discussed about various Reasons Why India Is Still a Poor Country. [&#8230;]]]></description>
