								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Auditing</h2>
<p>An audit is a systematic and independent examination of books, accounts, statutory records, documents and vouchers of an organization to ascertain how far the financial statements as well as non-financial disclosures present a true and fair view of the concern. It also attempts to ensure that the books of accounts are properly maintained by the concern as required by law.<br />

<span id="more-272"></span></p>
<h3>Types of Audits</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Statutory or Compulsory Audits</h4>
<p>Statutory or Compulsory Audits refers to the audits of those organisations, whose audit is compulsory, under the laws applicable in that country. Under Statutory Audit the rules relating to the scope of audit, auditor’s qualifications, his rights, duties and responsibilities etc. are determined by the law, which can be increased by an agreement between the employer of the organisation and the auditor, but cannot be decreased in any situation.<br />
The following organisations mainly come under Statutory or Compulsory Audits</p>
<ol>
<li>Joint Stock Companies</li>
<li>Public Trusts</li>
<li>Reserve Bank and other nationalised Banks</li>
<li>Various Corporations, like Life Insurance Corporation Financial Corporations, etc.</li>
<li>Government Committees</li>
<li>Stock Brokers</li>
<li>Sole Proprietorship and Partnership firms whose Sales exceeding Rs. 20 lakhs or Receipts exceeding Rs. 10 lakhs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Voluntary or Private Audits</h4>
<p>This is the opposite of Compulsory or Statutory Audit. In this, if the employer wants, then only he can get his accounts audited as per his free will. In this way, there are some private organisations which get their accounts audited privately, as per their free will, these are</p>
<ol>
<li>Sole Proprietor business</li>
<li>Audits of Partnership firms</li>
<li>Other persons like – doctors, lawyers etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these are not compulsorily bound by the law to get their accounts audited.</li>
<li>
<h4>Government Audits</h4>
<p>The Central and State governments have established a separate department for investigation of their accounts which is called : <strong>Department of Comptroller Auditor General</strong>. This department investigates and audits the accounts of government and government companies. Its highest official is the <em><strong>Comptroller and Auditor General</strong></em>, and this department presents its report before the government.</li>
<li>
<h4>Interim Audits</h4>
<p>When an audit has to be performed in the middle of the year for some special objectives, it is called Interim or Middle Audit. For example, audits performed at the middle of the year for declaring interim dividend, etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Periodical, Annual and Final Audits</h4>
<p>Such an audit is done at the end of the year, when all the books of accounts are closed, and final<br />
accounts are prepared. In this audit the auditor checks the accounts of the organisation only once during the year. This is also called Periodical, Annual, Final Audits and also known as Balance Sheet Audits.</li>
<li>
<h4>Internal Audits</h4>
<p>In big business enterprises, when some trustworthy, experienced and honest persons of the organisation under the guidance of an officer check the accounts of the enterprise, such kind of audits are called <em>Internal Audit</em> and the officers who perform this are called <em>Internal Auditors</em>. Internal auditor works as a policeman. As, in the presence of a policeman the ill elements are gripped with fear, similarly, in the presence of internal auditor the employees of the organisation remain alert and do not try to commit fraud or mistakes. In addition, the internal auditor also checks, whether the organisation is following the rules framed for it in all matters or not. He also gives valuable suggestions to the management of the organisation in view of making necessary improvements in the rules and regulation and making other arrangements more effective. By knowing the practical importance of ‘Internal Audit’, today usually all big companies make arrangements for internal audit in their offices. It is worth mentioning that <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/internal-check/"><em>Internal Check</em></a> is not same as Internal Auditing.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cash Audits</h4>
<p>When any business organisation or partnership firm appoints an auditor only to check its cash transactions, such kind of audits are called <em>Cash Audits</em>. While preparing his report, the auditor must mention. in such kind of audits, that it is only a <em>Cash Audits</em>.</li>
<li>
<h4>Continuous Audits</h4>
<p>Under this system, the auditor performs audit all throughout the year at definite and indefinite intervals. Usually under this system, the day on which the auditor and his audit staff visits the businessman, they checks the accounts up to that date and comes back after some days and starts from where they had left last time, up to that day. This sequence of checking goes on during the whole year and at the end of the year audit of only a small period remains, which he completes after the end of the year.<br />
According to W.W. Bigg</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #339966;">Continuous Audits are that in which the audit staff is continuously busy the year round in checking of accounts.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In the following organisations Continuous Audit is more useful and necessary</p>
<ol>
<li>Where immediately at the end of the year Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account are needed, Like – Banks, Insurance Companies etc.</li>
<li>Where business transactions and contracts are in large quantity and it is necessary to check these transactions continuously.</li>
<li>Where system of ‘Internal Check’ is not applicable and if it is applicable, it is unsatisfactory.</li>
<li>Where possibilities of irregularities and frauds are more and detailed investigation of accounts is necessary.</li>
<li>Where several times during the year, timely preparation of reports and accounts is compulsory, like – various branch offices which have to send various accounts and statements to their head offices several times during the year.</li>
<li>In big sized companies, like Electricity company, Gas company, Petrol company etc., where for completion of audit the auditor requires several months.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Standard Audits</h4>
<p>In this kind of audits some items are checked in detail in full and other items are checked lightly at a glance only. According to Prof. Ronald A. Irish, “Whenever some chosen specific items have to be fully and deeply audited and the balance has to be seen in overview, this kind of audit is called Standard Audit.</li>
<li>
<h4>Management Audits</h4>
<p>In ordinary language, <em>Management Audits</em> is a voluntary system of the appraisal and evaluation of the — efficiency of the management, to run an organisation. Under this the auditor has to examine all activities concerning each area of the administration of the organisation and give his report on the extent of success of the management in achieving its predetermined objectives, and how its efficiency can be enhanced further.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cost Audit</h4>
<p>Cost Audit refers to the investigation of the cost accounts and certifying them. Under cost audit, it is observed, whether or not the institution has prepared its cost accounts, according to the nature of activities carried on by it. Through cost audit, cost control and quality control both also becomes possible. , In the words of Prof. Smith and Day,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cost Audit refers to the detailed investigation of the cost accounting system and procedure by which its fairness can be proved, and achievement of the objectives of cost accounting may be assured.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have already discussed about purpose and objectives of <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking/">Routine Checking</a>. In this article we will go through some merits and demerits of <em>Routine Checking</em>.</p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-196"></span></p>
<h2>Merits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Mathematical Accuracy</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" /> The mathematical mistakes of the books of accounts are known from this type of checking, it confirms that the accounts are mathematically accurate.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is very easy. It can be done even by a person of ordinary abilities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Basis of Final Checking</h4>
<p>It also helps in the checking of Trial Balance and Final Accounts. In fact, it is the basis of checking of Final Accounts, on which basis the auditor prepares his report.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowledge of Errors and Frauds</h4>
<p>Through this, the errors, frauds and misappropriation of accounts are known.</li>
<li>
<h4>Knowing Errors in Posting</h4>
<p>Generally, the chances of mistake are more in ledger, in accounting work. By routine checking it can be known, whether the work of ledger posting is done properly or not.</li>
<li>
<h4>Tracing out Change in Figures</h4>
<p>Various secret Ticks and Marks are used during the process. If any change is made in figures after the checking, it can be easily traced.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demerits Of Routine Checking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Carelessness in Work</h4>
<p>The work of routine checking is not of any specific ability, thus, it is done by junior employees. These junior employees take routine check as a mere formality and finish the work quickly and carelessly, due to which chances of various mistakes remaining undetected are there. In fact, this fault is not of routine check but of the persons doing the work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Errors of Principle remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Persons doing routine checking are not much qualified, thus they do not have full knowledge of the Principles of Accounting. Thus, the errors of principle of accounting remain undetected.</li>
<li>
<h4>Monotonous Work</h4>
<p>Since, the work of routine checking goes on in a continuous process, the employees get bored in their work and they don’t take interest in their work.</li>
<li>
<h4>Cleverly done Frauds remain Undetected</h4>
<p>Small mathematical and other inaccuracies can be known through this technique, but cleverly and intelligently planned big frauds cannot be known.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Routine Checking</h2>
<p>Whether a business is big or small, the record of its daily transactions is kept in the books of accounts. The daily checking of these books of accounts under audit is called <em>Routine Checking</em>. Usually this work is done by the junior staff of the auditor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/routine-checking-merits-demerits/">Merits and Demerits of Routine Checking</a> are also discussed in later articles.</p>
<p><span id="more-93"></span></p>
<h3>Purpose of Routine Checking</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-154 alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Routine Checking" width="300" height="116" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Making totals and sub-totals of primary books of accounts, carrying them forward to the next page, and calculating the balances and their checking.</li>
<li>Checking of the ledger postings derived from the primary books and journal, and to see whether they are properly done or not.</li>
<li>To see the totals of debits and-credits of different accounts and their balances.</li>
<li>To check whether balances of various accounts are properly taken to the Trial Balance, or not.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Objectives Of Routine Checking</h3>
<p>The routine serves the following objectives</p>
<ol>
<li>To know the mathematical accuracy of the accounts, entered in the primary books of accounts.</li>
<li>To know the regularity of accounting in primary books of accounts.</li>
<li>By making use of distinct Ticks and Marks to know that no changes are made in figures after the check.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ticks And Marks Used In Routine Checking</h2>
<p>While doing routine checking, some signs of different colors are used. These are called Ticks or Check Marks. The main points related to this are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Precautions</h4>
<p>The following precautions must be taken while using these marks</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark should be small and clear.</li>
<li>Marks should not be of the same color in which accounts are written.</li>
<li>Different colors of marks must be used for different activities.</li>
<li>Marks must be changed each year.</li>
<li>The meanings of marks must be kept secret.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Place of Ticks and Marks</h4>
<p>The place of making the mark must be decided beforehand because along with the colors, types of marks, the place of its use are also very important. Usually for verifying the postings in accounts, mark is made on the left side of the amount. On checking the voucher with the amount, mark is made on the right side. On verifying the total, mark is made below the total etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Importance of Ticks and Marks</h4>
<p>The Ticks and Marks have great importance in verification. Prof. Emerson while expressing the importance of Ticks &amp; Marks has written that during audit, Ticks and Marks must be kept in mind, in the same way as while walking, we keep track of the road in mind, while talking we keep words in mind and while shopping pocket kept in mind. In all these situations, a little carelessness creates various problems.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Meaning Of Internal Check</h2>
<p>Internal check system is a part of the internal control system of the business. This is also called <em>Internal Block</em>. Each trader wants that he should be able to control the internal activities of his business, in such a manner that he can get maximum profits and the. chances of mistakes, fraud, etc., are could be minimum. The system of internal check is one such arrangement, in which the activities of employees are divided in such a manner that the work of one employee is independently checked by the other employee. Unless all employees of the organisation are become united, the chances of fraud etc., is not there.</p>
<p><span id="more-91"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-medium wp-image-265" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/internal-check-300x202.jpg" alt="Internal Check" width="300" height="202" /><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">Internal Check</p></div>
<p>For example – Suppose a customer presents a cheque of ₹1000 to the bank for payment. If all the works of checking the cheque, its investigation, its entry in books of accounts and payment of that cheque are done by a single bank employee, then he can by increasing a zero in ₹1000, make it ₹10000 in the bank books, give payment of ₹1000 only to the customer and can keep himself inappropriately the balance of ₹9000.</p>
<p>If the work of encashment of cheques is divided among three employees, one shall investigate the cheque, and make entries in the books of accounts. Second employee shall check this entry and send it to the third employee making cheque payments. The third employee shall make payment to the customer. In this system a single work is divided among three persons, and the work of first employee is automatically (without any special efforts) checked by the second employee, and the third employee shall make the payment of ₹1000 written in the cheque. In such a case, misappropriation cannot happen, unless all three employees unite.</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>According to Spicer and Pegler</p>
<blockquote><p>The internal check is such a system of management of a business, in which the work which is to be done by the employees is divided by the organisation in such a manner, that no employee can do the written accounting work of a transaction from the beginning to the end, and the work of each employee is also surely and independently checked by another employee, so that without any joint and pre-planned efforts of all employees, the happening of mistakes and frauds becomes impossible, and if any mistake occurs, it is immediately detected at the time of accounting, by another employee.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scope of this type of audit is very wide, but the problem arises in determining the analysis and limits of those welfare activities. Only after the analysis and determination of limits of these services, the scope of social audit can be determined, and the auditor can analyse those activities which the industry performs for the society.<br />
In this way, it is clear that the responsibility of social audit is to attain social objectives. The attainment of this object is possible only when the auditor presents his unbiased report after its examination, as to what extent the industry has carried out its responsibilities, and whether there is any deficiency in carrying out there responsibilities, the reasons behind it and the method of solving them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Verification Of Assets</h2>
<p>For verification of any assets the auditor has to mainly check some general points, which are almost similar for all kinds of assets, still according to the name of the asset, the auditor verifies them in the following manner</p>
<p>The main parameters to verify the value of an asset are</p>
<ul>
<li>Debtors</li>
<li>Goodwill</li>
<li>Trade Mark</li>
<li>Land and Buildings</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-87"></span></p>
<h5>Debtors</h5>
<p>The auditor should verify this asset carefully because it- might be that full amount has been received from a debtor, but the whole amount is not shown as a receipt and some portion of that amount is shown as discount to debtor and that amount of discount has been fraudulently stolen by the firm by not giving this discount to debtors. This may also be possible that cash may be received from debtor but it is not deposited in his account and theft, and the debt of that person (debtor) is shown as a Bad Debt and written off from Profit and Loss account. The auditor shall verify this asset in the following manner.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Attaining the List</h6>
<p>The auditor shall attain a certified list of total debtors of the firm, from a responsible officer. He shall also attain the necessary documents and receipts of debtors relating to total amount of bad debts.</li>
<li>
<h6>Communication with the Debtors</h6>
<p>If the auditor considers it necessary, he shall communicate with the debtors independently and confirm whether. The amount remaining in balance at the end of the year is also according to their books or not.</li>
<li>
<h6>Checking Bad Debts and Discount to Debtors</h6>
<p>The auditor should see that discount to debtors is given as per the rules and which officer is authorised to give, this rebate. He should also see whether on each discount, the signature of that officer is present or not. Similarly, if for any loan it seems that it is not recoverable and it is written as a Bad debt, the auditor should also check that the officer who has written it, in Bad Debts account was authorised to do so, or not, because it is possible that after showing it as a Bad Debt, the loan was recovered from the debtor and distributed between the officer and the debtor, fraudulently.</li>
<li>
<h6>Checking of Securities</h6>
<p>If any cash loan is given by the organisation by taking some security, then such securities should also be checked.</li>
<li>
<h6>Presentation in the Balance Sheet</h6>
<p>The auditor should see whether any special law applies on that organisation, or not. If any special law applies then he should see that according to that law, how the debtors should be shown in the Balance Sheet. As according to the Companies Act, it is compulsory for the company to show its loans under the following heads</p>
<ul>
<li>Loans which are considered receivable and for which the company is fully secured.</li>
<li>Loans which are considered receivable but in relation to which the company does not have any other security other than the personal security of the debtor.</li>
<li>Loans which are considered Bad and Doubtful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If no special law applies on the organisation, the auditor shall see that debtors are shown in a manner as shown in other ordinary business organisations.<br />
An important case relating to showing of debtors in the Balance Sheet, is London &amp; General Bank case. In this case, the auditor of London &amp; General Bank Ltd. was held responsible for breach of duty because he did not reveal this fact to the shareholders of the bank in his report that he has shown various loans as asset (debtors) in the Balance Sheet and interest earned on them also shown in the Profit &amp; Loss account as a profit, whereas; fact was this that the chances of recovery of these loans were almost nil, though the auditor was quite aware of this fact.</p>
<h5>Goodwill</h5>
<p>Goodwill is an intangible asset. If it is separated from business then it has no value. Its value depends on the increase and decrease of the profits of the business. If there is any additional profit in any business then the goodwill of the business is considered big.<br />
Goodwill is a separate asset from other assets of the business, its valuation also cannot be done like other assets-of the business because neither it depreciates, nor it requires reconstruction and repairs, etc., or it needs to be replaced.<br />
Goodwill is valued in an organisation in the following two cases</p>
<ul>
<li>While purchasing a running business, in such a case, the Purchase Price of goodwill is known by deducting net assets from the Purchase Price, i.e., (Goodwill = Purchasing Price — Net Asset). For example, if a running business is purchased for Rs. 100000 and the Purchase Price of the assets of the organisation is Rs. 80000, then the goodwill of that organisation will be, 100000 — 80000 = Rs. 20000.</li>
<li>When a new partner is taken in a partnership or any old partner separates from the business, then a goodwill account is opened, at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both the above cases the following method is adopted for the Verification of Goodwill</p>
<ol>
<li>On purchase of goodwill, the auditor must study the contract with the vendor (seller of goodwill) and see that it is shown at the proper value in the books of accounts or not.</li>
<li>If goodwill arises with admission of a new partner in the business or on separation, then the auditor must see the Partnership Deed.</li>
<li>In the Balance Sheet goodwill must be shown at Cost Price.</li>
<li>Sometimes goodwill is written off, and re-opened due to some reasons. If this is done, then the auditor must study the copy of resolution passed by the directors.</li>
<li>Even after complete investigations, if the auditor is not satisfied with the amount of goodwill, then he should state this clearly in his, report.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Trade Mark</h5>
<p>When a product is registered with a specific symbol so that no other producer is permitted by the law to use that symbol. That product and its manufacturer are also identified by that symbol.<br />
For trade mark, the auditor has to perform the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>If any organisation or its branches has more than one trademarks, the auditor must obtain a list of all trademarks which should contain the details of serial number, date, duration, fees etc.</li>
<li>If trade mark is obtained by paying some amount to another person, the investigation of this payment must be made by the payment receipt, received from him.</li>
<li>If trade mark is such that it is registered for the first time, then the fees paid for registration must be verified from the receipt of the payment made.</li>
<li>If the trade mark is renewed, then the amount paid in renewal should be checked by the receipt which is received against that payment.</li>
<li>The auditor must see the period of trade mark from the Registration certificate attained. The period of a trade mark is usually not more than 14 years. Thus, he should see that during this period, provision for depreciation is provided on trade mark or not. The rate of depreciation should be such that by the time of the expiry of the period of trade mark, it should be fully written off.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Land And Building<img class="size-full wp-image-260 alignright" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/building-1-1.jpeg" alt="Verification Parameters" width="240" height="160" /></h5>
<ol>
<li>If building is purchased, its verification must be done on the basis of the contract.</li>
<li>If building is constructed on contract, it must be verified by the certificates of contractors and experts.</li>
<li>If building is constructed by the employees of the organisation only, then the certificate of the responsible officer must be obtained.</li>
<li>Building must be shown in the Balance Sheet, after deducting appropriate depreciation on it.</li>
<li>The existence of the building should be seen by the auditor himself.</li>
<li>Building must be shown at cost price only. The auditor must see that no profits earned by the organisation, are fraudulently included in this amount.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Meaning Of Verification</h4>
<p>It is the duty of the auditor that he specifically writes in his report whether the financial position of the organisation represented in the Balance Sheet is proper or not. He must make sure that all the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present with the organisation or not, the organisation has valued them properly or not, they are free from all kinds of mortgages etc. or not. Similarly he has &#8216;to make sure about all liabilities also. In this way the auditor evaluates the assets and liabilities of the organisation and verifies them, and this work of the auditor is called <em>Verification</em>.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2016/12/verification-parameters/">Verification Parameters</a></p>
<p><span id="more-84"></span></p>
<p>It is clear that verification of assets is such a process by which the auditor certifies that the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are correct. Explaining the complete objective of verification J.R. Batliboi Boy has said that</p>
<blockquote><p>Auditor should satisfy himself that the assets are actually present on the date of Balance Sheet and they are free of any charge or mortgage and their valuation is done in proper manner.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-154 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/verified-300x116.jpg" alt="Verification of Assets" width="300" height="116" />The auditor must take all kinds of care in relation to assets. He should check all documents of title, receipts etc. related to the assets. Mostly these documents of title are with the trader but if they are with some other person like banks etc., then they should be attained from them. He should not show any kind of relaxation in this. In relation to verification of assets, the position of an auditor is specified in a court case that for verification of assets, the auditor should take care of the following points</p>
<ol>
<li>All the assets are included in the Balance Sheet of the organisation and are shown clearly.</li>
<li>Assets are valued properly</li>
<li>On the date of preparation of Balance Sheet the assets were physically present with the organisation.</li>
<li>All the assets were in possession of the organisation and were free from any charge or mortgage.</li>
<li>Assets were owned by the organisation and not by anyone else.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Objectives Of Verification</h4>
<p>The main objective of verification is to check the following<br />
points</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether all assets and liabilities are mathematically accurate or not.</li>
<li>All assets are properly accounted for, as per the rules of the organisation and legal provisions, or not</li>
<li>All the assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present or not, and at the time of preparation of Balance Sheet they were present with the organisation, or not.</li>
<li>Any such change.is made in an asset which is not shown in the Balance Sheet. In other words, assets are shown keeping in view all the related provisions, or not.</li>
<li>Whether fictitious Assets are written off adequately, or not.</li>
<li>Valuation of assets and liabilities is done according to the accounting principles or not and valuation is correct according to the previous year, or not.</li>
<li>No fraud or irregularities occurred in relation to the assets and liabilities of the organisation.</li>
<li>All the assets and liabilities of the organisation are shown or not and none is hidden.</li>
<li>Assets shown in the Balance Sheet are actually present or not and they are owned by the organisation or not. It might be that some assets are not in the possession of the organisation, like &#8211; on taking a loan from bank, the assets or stock of the organisation is kept in the goodwill of the bank. But in such a case, the organisation has legal right over such asset, and it is considered the property of the organisation.</li>
