<div id="attachment_319" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-image-319 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/robbins-1-1.jpg" alt="Robbins definition of Economics" width="220" height="289" /><p id="caption-attachment-319" class="wp-caption-text">Prof Lionel Robbins</p></div>
<p>Robbins definition of Economics challenged Dr.<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/06/economics-marshall-definition/"> Marshall definition of Economics</a> which was a major improvement over the definition of Adam Smith and other ancient Economists. Before Prof. Lionel Robbins, Prof. Marshall tried to give complete and faultless definition of economics. At that time people started thinking that the Economic Science has completely develop and matured. But in 1932, after the publication of Prof. Robbins&#8217;s book <strong><em>An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Social Science</em></strong>, <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">a controversy roused in the field of Economics</a>. He tried to give economics another shape, apart from material welfare. In the words of Robbins</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relation between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-312"></span></p>
<h2>Characteristics Of Robbins Definition</h2>
<p>Following are the main characteristics of Robbins&#8217; definition</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Unlimited Wants</h4>
<p>According to Prof Robbins definition, human wants are unlimited. On satisfaction of one wants, another want arises immediately.and this sequence continues forever.</li>
<li>
<h4>Scarce Means</h4>
<p>Robbins definition stated that through on one side human needs are unlimited yet on the other side, the means to satisfy these wants, like- time, power, money etc. are also limited. Due to this, many of man&#8217;s needs remain unsatisfied.</li>
<li>
<h4>Alternative Use of Scarce Means</h4>
<p>In Robbins&#8217;s view though the to &#8216;satisfy man&#8217;s needs are scarce, yet he has alternative uses. In other words, he can use every resource in various objectives and activities. For example &#8211; such a resource like land can be use in many ways, such as it can be used for agriculture or for building a house or to established a factory etc.</li>
<li>
<h4>Variation in the Intensity of wants</h4>
<p>Robbins definition states that the intensity of man&#8217;s needs is different. Some wants are more intense than the others. Since our means are limited and all wants cannot be satisfied with the limited means; as a result, we have to select some more intense wants from our unlimited wants and the less intense wants have to be either dropped or postponed to a future date.</li>

<h3>Introduction Of Marshall</h3>
<div id="attachment_288" style="width: 223px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-image-288 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alfred_Marshall-213x300.jpg" alt="Principle Of Economics" width="213" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-288" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Alfred Marshall</p></div>
<p>Marshall definition of Economics was first to challenge Adam Smith definition. Dr. Alfred Marshall (Born. 26 July, 1842, Died 13 July 1924) was the first Economist, who denied the wealth related definitions of Adam Smith, which was in vogue for a long time, in his two books published in 1890 named <strong>Principles of Economics</strong> and <strong>Economics of Industry</strong>, and declared them wrong, and defined it as not the study of human welfare. He gave, &#8216;Man&#8217; the first place and Wealth&#8217; as secondary and clarified that wealth is for man and man is not for wealth. Wealth is not the &#8216;End&#8217;, it is only a &#8216;Means&#8217; to attain welfare. He presented the definition of Economics in this manner in his book &#8216;Economics of Industry&#8217;.</p>
<p>However Marshall definition was also <a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/marshall-definition-criticism/">criticized</a> later by a renowned Professor of &#8216;London School of Economics&#8217;, Prof. Leonel Robbins in his book &#8216;<a href="http://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/07/economics-robbins-definition/">An Essay of the Nature and Significance of Social Science</a>&#8216; in 1932.<br />
<span id="more-287"></span></p>
<h2>Marshall Definition Of Economics</h2>
<p>Economics is the study of human activities in the ordinary course of business. It studies how man attains his income and how he utilizes it. In this way, it studies wealth, on one hand and on the other hand, it is a part of the study of man, which is more important.<br />
According to this definition, it becomes the science of human activities instead of science of wealth. In his second book, &#8216;Principles of Economics&#8217;, Dr. Marshall defined it in these words</p>
<blockquote><p>Economics is the study of humans, in relation to the ordinary business of life. It studies that portion of the personal and social activities, which are closely related to the attainment of material resources, related to welfare and its utilization.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Characteristics Of Marshall&#8217;s Definition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Greater Emphasis on Human Aspect</h4>
<p>Marshall has given a balanced importance to <em>Means</em> and <em>Ends</em>, through his definition. He has stated in clear words, that it is on one hand is the study of wealth and on the other hand, more important to this is the study of human aspect. In this way, he removed the defect of ignorance of human aspect, in the old views of Adam Smith&#8217;s time, and gave more emphasis to human aspect in clear words.</li>
<li>
<h4>Material Welfare</h4>
<p>Marshall in his definition gave more importance to the means of material gains or material welfare. According to him, it studies, those material resources, on which welfare depends. In this a way, Marshall accepted the material welfare aspect. Other famous economists like &#8211; Pigou, Cannon, Beveridge etc. also supported it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of Social, Normal and Real Persons</h4>
<p>According to Marshall, economics studies only social, normal and real persons. The study of persons living outside the society or in forests, who-are unusual, alone and abnormal, is not done in it. The activities of unusual persons like &#8211; an insane, a miser, a saint or Mahatma etc. are said to be outside the area of the subject Matter of economics. According to Marshall, it studies the economic activities of only the social, normal and real persons.</li>
<li>
<h4>Study of the Ordinary Business Activities of Life</h4>
<p>In his definition, Marshall paid emphasis to the <em>Ordinary Business Activities</em>. These &#8216;ordinary business activities&#8217; refers to those economic activities, which are related to the attainment and utilization of wealth. In this manner, Marshall gave a clear place, to human economic activities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Practical Point of View</h4>
<p>Marshall adopted a more practical point of view, in defining economics, He gave equal importance to both theoretical and practical aspects of economic activities, and accepted the scientific and artistic aspects of economics.</li>
<li>
<h4>Simple and Clear Definition</h4>
<p>The definition given by Marshall is very simple and clear. According to him, economics studies the activities of earning and expending wealth by man.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction to Keynesian Theory of Employment</h2>
<div id="attachment_149" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149" class="wp-image-149 size-medium" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Keynes-300x225.jpg" alt="Keynesian Theory of Employment" width="300" height="225" /><p id="caption-attachment-149" class="wp-caption-text">John Maynard Keynes</p></div>
<p>Keynesian Theory was given by Keynes when in his volume “<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</span></em>” had not only criticized the <strong>Classical Theory of Employment</strong>, but had also analyzed those factors that affect the employment and production level of an economy. Most of the modern economists agree with the concept of Keynes. The Keynesian Theory of Employment is a produce of the world-wide depression of 1931-36. Due to this depression, unemployment spread in all independent capitalist economies. Keynes analyzed that situation of unemployment and tried to find the reason and solution to that problem.<span id="more-54"></span><br />
During that time, the theories of British economist John Maynard Keynes—of deficit-based, government stimulus spending and strong regulation of markets—dominated economic policy and thought.</p>
<h2>Explanation of the Theory of Employment</h2>
<p><em>“Classical theory of Employment”</em>, but had also analyzed those factors that affect the employment and production level of an economy. Most of the modern economists agree with the concept of Keynes. The Keynesian Theory of Employment is a produce of the world-wide depression of 1931-36. Due to this depression, unemployment spread in all independent capitalist economies. Keynes analyzed that situation of unemployment and tried to find the reason and solution to that problem.</p>
<p>According to this theory, since the demand for goods and services is not so much that the total actual resources may be utilized, unemployment arises. In the words of Keynes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The deficiency in effective demand, stops the increase in employment to reach the full employment level.</p></blockquote>
<p>On an increase in the effective demand of the consumers, the resources are utilized in large quantities, and the level of employment rises. When people start demanding another product in place of a product temporarily, unemployment would increase due to fall in total demand, it shall be of irregular nature. Actually, a permanent fall in demand occurs, when instead of making expenditure on consumer goods, people try to save most part of their incomes. A deficiency in demand for goods and services in one sector of the society in not compensated by an increase in demand for goods and services in another sector, and total demand declines. Thus, if the desire to save from their particular income is more than the desire for substitution expenditure have become a reverse relationship, demand and employment increases i.e., when the desire to save, among people is lesser than the substitution expenditure in the society, demand and employment increases.</p>
<p>In Keynes view, the level of employment of any country depends on its effective demand. Effective demand depends on total supply of production and the total demand. The total supply of a production depends on total investment and total consumption. The amount of consumption is affected by the tendency for consumption, and the size of national income. As the income of a person increases, his tendency to consume comparatively reduces. On the other hand, it depends on the amount of investment, rate of interest, and mostly on the marginal efficiency of capital. In the money market, the demand for capital shall be more even during the period of high rates of interest, if in view of the investors, capital is more efficient. The marginal efficiency of capital depends on the substitution cost and the anticipated profits.</p>
<h2>Reasons of Spreading of Unemployment</h2>
<p>According to Keynes, the three main reasons of spreading of unemployment are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of effective demand</li>
<li>Deficiency of outlay on consumption</li>
<li>Deficiency of investment</li>
</ol>
