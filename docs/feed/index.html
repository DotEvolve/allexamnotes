								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Definition of Sole Proprietorship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/03/sole-proprietorship/">Sole Proprietorship</a> definition according to Prof Hynes</p>
<blockquote><p>Sole Proprietorship is that form of business which has a single owner, who has the total responsibility of the business, who runs the business and also bears the risk on the failure of business.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Despite high mortality the sole entrepreneur survives.</strong></p>
<p>In the words of Dr. John A Shubin</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the Sole Trader-ship Business, a single man is an organizer; he is the owner and runs the business by his own name.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-447"></span></p>
<h2>DISADVANTAGES, DEMERITS OR LIMITATIONS OF SOLE TRADER SHIP (PROPRIETORSHIP)</h2>
<p>Following are the main demerits of this system</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Limited Capital</h4>
<p>The arrangement of capital in sole trader business has to be done by its owner from his private resources, which could be limited to his friends and relatives. Thus, due to limited capital, the business also becomes limited.</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Management Skills</h4>
<p>The organisation and management of sole trade business is done by its owner, whose mental efficiency and skills are limited up to a certain extent. On this ba-sis the development of business also becomes limited up to that extent.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unlimited Liability</h4>
<p>A sole proprietor has to bear the loss of his business himself, because he is the sole owner of the business. If the losses of business cannot be recovered from the assets of the business then his private property may be utilised to recover the loss.</li>
<li>
<h4>Loss in Absence</h4>
<p>The success of sole proprietorship depends on the supervision of the proprietor. If due to certain reasons, like &#8211; ill health etc., the proprietor remains absent from office or goes out of station, the efficiency of work starts declining, because whole responsibility of work would be on employees, and they would never work at the same level of efficiency.</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Credit</h4>
<p>The credibility of each person is limited. Since sole proprietorship business belongs to a single person, thus, his credit also is limited up to a certain extent. Thus, he is unable to attain the required amount of loan and other facilities beyond that extent. This restricts the progress of the business.</li>
<li>
<h4>Doubtful Secrecy</h4>
<p>For a sole proprietor business, secrecy in business matters becomes a big problem. Due to secrecy, the money lenders who give money to sole proprietor doubts the financial position of him, and it becomes difficult for him to attain more loans from money lenders.</li>
<li>
<h4>Temporary Existence</h4>
<p>The existence of a sole proprietorship firm is not permanent. When the owner of the business dies, or becomes incapable of carrying on the business due to certain reasons, and there is no heir or successor to his business, the business automatically comes to an end. It is also not necessary that his heir is able to successfully run the business, as he previously did.</li>
<li>
<h4>Limited Business Area</h4>
<p>It is very difficult for a sole proprietor to expand his business after a certain limit. Thus, business of sole proprietor runs in a limited area.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unsuitable for Big Business</h4>
<p>After knowing all the disadvantages it can be said that for big business projects, sole proprietorship system is unsuitable.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/04/sole-proprietorship-merits/"><strong>IS SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP THE BEST</strong></a></p>
<h3>IS SOLE TRADE ALWAYS SMALL?</h3>
<p>It would not be justified to say sole proprietorship is the best, by analysing the above merits. After watching all the points it can be said that &#8220;Sole proprietorship is the best only up to the point, when its size is small, because a single person (its owner) cannot control it when its size increases beyond a limit&#8221;. Thus, sole proprietor business is not always small, but it is the best, in a small size.</p>

The same personals the manager and organizer of the business.</p>
<h2>Definition of Sole Proprietorship</h2>
<p>According to Prof Hynes</p>
<blockquote><p>Sole Proprietorship is that form of business which has a single owner, who has the total responsibility of the business, who runs the business and also bears the risk on the failure of business.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Despite high mortality the sole entrepreneur survives.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>IMPORTANCE OR BENEFITS OF THE LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility/">Law of Equi-Marginal Utility</a> has an important place in economics. Even though it is highly <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-criticism-and-limitation/">criticized</a>, its importance cannot be ignored. This applies in the every field of economics, which is clear from the following<br />
<span id="more-432"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Consumption</h4>
<p>This law is very important in the field of consumption because every consumer wants to get maximum satisfaction from his limited income. Along with those goods which consumers are consuming presently; they also keep goods for future consumption, so that they can get equal utility at both the times.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Fieid of Production</h4>
<p>Usually, producer has capital in a limited quantity but he wants to get maximum profit from his investment (Capital) and it is possible only when the production cost would be less and production would be more. So, the producer uses the cheap and more production giving means (factors of production), at the place of expensive means, until marginal productivity of both the means become equal. In this way, law of Equi-marginal Utility is also applicable in the field of production.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Fieldof Exchange</h4>
<p>The main basis of exchange, is this law, because in exchange, goods are purchased and told through money and in every exchange, we compare the utility receiving with utility, giving in return. We keep trying to exchange up to that extent, unless the utility giving become equal, to the utility received. Thus, law equi-marginal Utility is the basis of exchange.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Distribution</h4>
<p>In the field of distribution, this law is helpful in distributing the remuneration in factors of production. National income is distributed in Land, Labour, Capital and Organisation. Share of factors of production is determined according to their marginal productivity. Hence, the producer uses that particular factor more; the marginal productivity of which is more, than its remuneration.</li>
<li>
<h4>In the Field of Public Finance</h4>
<p>In the field of public finance also, this law has very importance. The Principle of Maxirrtum Social Advantage is also based on the Law of qui marginal Utility Government charges more tax from rich and charges less tax from poor people and spend that income in such a ipisray that the poor can get more benefit in comparison to rich persons.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>It is clear from the above analysis that Law of equi-marginal Utility is an important basic law of Economics and it is used at wide level. According to Marshall</p>
<blockquote><p>This law is applicable in almost every field of economic research.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>CRITICISMS, LIMITATIONS OR EXCEPTIONS OF LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY</h2>
<p>Following are the main reasons for the criticism of the <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility/">Law of Equi-marginal utility</a> by H. H. Gossen. Although, it is a basic law of economics and consumers knowingly or unknowingly are compelled, to follow this law. This law is applicable in every field of economic analysis.<br />
<span id="more-431"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Generally Consumers are not Calculative by Nature</h4>
<p>Consumers do not spend their income on the basis of calculations, rather they spend their income, according to their habits.</li>
<li>
<h4>Indivisibility of Goods</h4>
<p>Several commodities, such as &#8211; Scooters, .T.V., Machines etc. cannot be divided into small units. Therefore, the comparison of the utility of these units is not possible and also these cannot be compared with marginal unit of other commodities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Consumers are not Rational</h4>
<p>Generally, man is influenced with customs, traditions,habits and fashion. So, he spends his income unintentionally on the commodities that give less utility. Hence, he is not always rational.</li>
<li>
<h4>Correct Measurement of Utility is not Possible</h4>
<p>Correct measurement of utility is not possible because utility is a mental satisfaction.</li>
<li>
<h4>Utility of Money is not Stable</h4>
<p>Like commodities, the utility of money also keep on decreasing. Moreover, the prices of commodities keep on changing (increases and decreases) whereas, money assumed stable in this law.</li>
<li>
<h4>Lack of Knowledge of Utility</h4>
<p>Generally, consumer does not have any knowledge, about the utility of commodities.</li>
<li>
<h4>Durability of Goods</h4>
<p>We keep on receiving utility in the long run, from durable goods. So, in short term the comparison of marginal utility of these goods, is impossible.</li>
<li>
<h4>Maximum Utility does not mean Maximum Satisfaction</h4>
<p>According to critics, actal utility can be maximised but total satisfaction cannot be maximised, by this law. But in practical life, Utility and Satisfaction both are two separates things and these have no direct relation.</li>
<li>
<h4>Unavailability of Few Goods</h4>
<p>Sometimes, Goods of higher utility are not available in the market and the consumer has to consume the goods of lesser utility, at the place of the goods of higher utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Supplementary Goods</h4>
<p>Some goods are supplementary to each other and these are used simultaneously in certain proportion. Such as, Car and Petrol. This law is not applicable, in respect of these goods.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>In spite of above practical difficulties in the implementation of Law of Equi-marginal Utility, this law cannot be considered mere imagination or unreal. In fact, it is a basic law of economics and consumers knowingly or unknowingly are compelled, to follow this law. <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/02/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-importance-and-benefits/">This law is applicable in every field of economic analysis</a>. According to Professor Chapman</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not compelled to distribute our income, according to the Law of Equi-marginal utility as a stone thrown in air is compelled in a sense to fall back on the earth; but as a matey of fact, we do so in a certain rough fashion, became we are reasonable.</p></blockquote>

<h2>INTRODUCTION OF LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY</h2>
<p>We know that wants of every man are unlimited. Wants arise again and again but man has limited means (income) to fulfill his wants and means have , alternative uses. Thus, man always face problem of distribution of limited means of alternative uses, on his wants; so that, he may get maximum satisfaction (or utility). Law of Equi-Marginal Utility presents the solution of this problem. This law states that if a person, wishes to get maximum satisfaction from his income, he should spend his income on different items, in such a way that the utility of last unit of money spent on each commodity, should be equal or almost equal. This law of consumption was propounded by a French Economist, H. H. Gossen in 1854 and it is also known as the <strong>Second Law of Gossen</strong>.<br />
<span id="more-416"></span></p>
<h3>DIFFERENT NAMES OF THE LAW</h3>
<p>Law of Equi-marginal utility is known with several names, such as; Law of Substitution, Law of Indifference, Law of Proportionality, Law of economy, etc.</p>
<h3>ASSUMPTIONS OF THE LAW</h3>
<p>The assumptions of this law are as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>Man (Consumer) is rational being and his aim is to get maximum satisfaction.</li>
<li>Marginal utility of money remains the same (equal).</li>
<li>Consumer spends his money in small quaritities.</li>
<li>Utility can be measured in the form of money.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Definition of Law of Equi-marginal Utility</h2>
<p>According to Gossen</p>
<blockquote><p>It is impossible to gratify all wants to the point of satisfaction. It is necessary, in order to obtain maximum satisfaction, to discontinue the satisfaction of different wants at a point at which their intensity has become equal.</p></blockquote>
<h3>EXPLANATION OF THE LAW</h3>
<div id="attachment_421" style="width: 186px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-421" class="wp-image-421 size-full" src="https://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Gossen-1-1.jpg" alt="H. H. Gossen" width="176" height="248" /><p id="caption-attachment-421" class="wp-caption-text">Hermann Heinrich Gossen</p></div>
<p>Law of Equi-marginal utility has three main basis</p>
<ol>
<li>Wants of human (consumer) are uniimi,ted.</li>
<li>Man has limited means but these means can be used alternatively.</li>
<li>Every person wants to get maximum satisfaction (utility) from his limited means.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, consuming commodity continuously one by one; consumer gets the utility at diminishing rate from each next unit. So, when the consumer spends, his limited income, on different heads, to get maximum satisfaction, he compares the utility of successive units of different heads and replaces the commodity that gives less utility by the commodity that gives utility and this replacement continues, until the marginal utility becomes equal.</p>
<p>This law is highly <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/01/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-criticism-and-limitation/">criticized</a> by some of the economists, but its <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2018/02/law-of-equi-marginal-utility-importance-and-benefits/">importance</a> is also acknowledged by many of them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Measurement of Utility</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/utility/">Utility</a> is a Psychological and Personal Concept. There is a deference of opinion, whether measurement of utility can be done or not. Followings are the two approaches are prevalent in this regard.<br />
<span id="more-413"></span></p>
<h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CARDINAL APPROACH AND ORDINAL APPROACH</h4>
<h3>CARDINAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>The economist Marshal and Pigou etc. have their view that utility can measured in the form of moneys According to them, a person will agree to pay for a commodity; just equal to the utility, which he derives from that commodity. If a person is willing to spend more for a commodity, it means that he gaining more (excessive or surplus) utility from that commodity. In this way, it can be said that price to be given for a commodity is a measurement of that commodity. For example, if a person is ready to pay 10 rupees for a coffee, the utility of that coffee for that person Will be equal to 10 rupees. Hence, it is clear from the above example that according to Prof. Marshall, the utility of a commodity can be expressed through Cardinal Numbers like 1,2,3,4 etc. When we express the utility of a commodity in this manner, it is called Ordinal Utility and this approach is Called <em>Cardinal Approach</em>. In other words, according to this approach, utility can be measured.</p>
<h3>ORDINAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>Contrary to above approach, some economists such as Perito, Ellen, Hicks etc. do not agree with approach of Prof. Marshall and Prof. Pigou. According to these economists, utility cannot be measured. These economists criticized cardinal approach of Marshall, on the basis of following points</p>
<ol>
<li>Utility is a psychological concept, which cannot be measured in the form of money.</li>
<li>Utility remains unstable.</li>
<li>Money is not the correct measurement of utility because the -value of money keeps changing itself.</li>
<li>The amount of money, which we are ready to pay to purchase a commodity, it shows only the estimated utility of the commodity, not the actual utility.</li>
<li>Money is not correct measurement of utility on the following ground also that if a poor man is unable to purchase a cycle, how we can say that there is no utility in cycle for him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prof. Pigou, who was supporter of Marshall&#8217;s approach earlier; accepted later that only intensity of desire can be measured by money, utility cannot be measured. Due to these difficulties&#8217; Prof. Hicks and other economist have finally accepted that utility cannot be measured and they developed a new method of analysis, <strong>Indifference curve analysis</strong> at the place of <em>Utility analysis</em>, in which there is no need to measure utility. In this method, only Ordinal Numbers 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th (serial order) are given for utility. In this way, the utility of shirt is more or less than that of bread is expressed by these serial numbers. Unit of utility has no meaning in Ordinal Approach. When measurement of utility of commodity is made, numbers are arranged in a serial order of their importance, such as, &#8216;First&#8217;, *Seconds and Third&#8217; etc.. For Example &#8211; three students getting highest numbers in a class are shown in an Ordinal Serial order of &#8216;First&#8217;, &#8216;Second&#8217;, and &#8216;Third&#8217;. When utility is given ordinal numbers, it is called Ordinal Utility and this approach is called <em>Ordinal Approach</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>At a given time the overall utility derived from the consumption of all units of a commodity is called Total Utility.</p>
<p><span id="more-405"></span></p>
<p>According to Professor Meyors,</p>
<blockquote><p>Total utility is the sum of <a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/marginal-utility/">marginal utilities</a>, associated with the consumption of successive units.</p></blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Units of Bread</th>
<th>Marginal Utility</th>
<th colspan="2">Total Utility</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>50</td>
<td rowspan="5">Increasing</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>
<p>t is clear from the table that consumption of one unit of bread yields utility equal to 50, While 90 utility is derived from the consumption of second unit. In this way, total 150 utility is derived from the consumption of 5 units of bread.</p>
<h3>Mutual relationship between two type of utilities</h3>
<p>It is dear from above table that</p>
<ol>
<li>From the consumption of each next unit of commodity, marginal utility is derived at decreasing rate and total utility increases.</li>
<li>It increases at decreasing rate.</li>
<li>When marginal utility is zero, it is maximum and positive</li>
<li>Even after getting the maximum satisfaction, if consumption still continues, Negative marginal utility is derived and due to this negative marginal utility, total utility also begin to decrease.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Definition of Marginal Utility</h2>
<p>Marginal Utility is the utility which is derived from the consumption of an additional unit of a commodity. In other words, it is the addition to<a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/total-utility/"> total utility</a>, resulting from adding one unit to the consumption of a commodity.</p>
<p>Example : Ram consumes 6 ice creams at a time. In this case, 6 ice creams will be the marginal unit and utility derived by him from adding one unit to the consumption of a commodity.</p>
<p><span id="more-390"></span></p>
<p>According to modern economist Prof. Bhatia,</p>
<blockquote><p>Marginal Utility may also be defined as the addition made to total utility by the increment of the last unit consumed.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Meaning of Utility</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.allexamnotes.com/2017/12/utility/">Utility</a> means the power that satisfies any want. It is such an internal quality which is found in all commodities desired by a person. The quality (power or capability) of commodity which satisfies the human want; directly or indirectly is called Utility. Those commodities, which have wants satisfying power are called &#8216;Useful Commodities&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Types of Marginal Utility</h2>
<p>The intensity of want of a commodity decreases due to continuous consumption of its successive units at the same time and a situation also comes, when more units of that commodity are consumed, worthlessness is derived at the place of utility.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Positive Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>Until we get maximum satisfaction by the consumption of a commodity, we feel the want of that commodity again and again. We get some satisfaction by the use of every unit. This type of utility is called Positive Marginal Utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Zero Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>When we do not get satisfaction from the consumption of next unit of a commodity and there is also no loss if we do not consume that commodity; at that time, the utility of that commodity will be zero for us. It is called Zero Marginal Utility.</li>
<li>
<h4>Negative Marginal Utility</h4>
<p>When disutility occurs from consumption of a commodity, it is called Negative Marginal Utility.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Clarification of Different types of Marginal Utility</h3>

</table>
<p>In the above table when a person consumes first unit of bread; he get utility equal to 50 cents. If, he continues the consumption of bread, he get the utility 40 from second unit and 30 from third unit, 20 from fourth unit and 10 from fifth unit and zero from sixth unit. Thus, it is clear that as he increases the number of units of bread; he gets utility at decreasing rate from each next unit. This process of positive utility continues till the consumption of fifth unit of bread, at this point, it becomes 10. Up to this level, the utility is Positive. He gets zero utility from consuming sixth unit of bread and this is the maximum limit of satisfaction.</p>
<p>If even after this limit, he continues the consumption of bread, he will get negative utility from seventh and eighth unit of bread. He will get dissatisfaction at the place of satisfaction.</p>

<p><img class="wp-image-373 size-thumbnail alignright" src="http://www.allexamnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/utility-150x150.jpg" alt="Utility" width="150" height="150" />Utility means the power that satisfies any want. It is such an internal quality; which is found in all commodities desired by a person. The quality (power or capability) of commodity which satisfies the human want; directly or indirectly is called <em>Utility</em>. Those commodities, which have wants satisfying power are called &#8216;<em>Useful Commodities</em>&#8216;.<br />
<span id="more-372"></span></p>
<h3>Concept of Utility</h3>
<p>Wants satisfying power&#8217; has two meanings</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity to gain satisfaction</li>
<li>Actual Realised satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated (Assumed) Satisfaction of a particular commodity can be equal to, less or more than, the satisfaction, actually realised by consuming that commodity. Estimated satisfaction for a certain commodity depends up on the intensity of desire of a particular person or depends on desirableness.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Utility</h3>
<ol>
<li>It is a psychological concept, which can only be felt. It cannot be seen.</li>
<li>It depends on the intensity of wants.</li>
<li>It differs from usefulness. Such as, Cigarette has satisfaction for cigarette smoker, but it is injurious (not useful) to health.</li>
<li>Its concept is indifferent from moral point of view.  Such as &#8211; Wine, in spite of being useful for a wine drinker; it is not considered good for moral point of view.</li>
<li>It is related with Consumable Goods only.</li>
<li>It is different from satisfaction</li>
<li>It does not depend on Actual consumption. It is assumption.</li>
<li>It is measurable.</li>
<li>It can be both positive as well as negative. Up to the point of maximum satisfaction, it is positive and after that negative utility is derived.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Types</h4>
